These devices could be targeted for many reasons, from attempting to obtain individual credit card numbers to industrial sabotage.Cyber attackers use a wide range of methods to steal credentials and compromise IoT devices, making any device that is connected to the internet vulnerable to attack without the necessary security. An attacker who gains control of an IoT device can steal sensitive data and conduct malicious activity across a network or take systems offline.Unfortunately, IoT security can be challenging as, fundamentally, IoT devices are not designed with security in mind.

With more and more IoT devices being developed to assist businesses and consumers in streamlining daily processes, the need for advanced security becomes increasingly important.Why Is IoT Security So Crucial?There are two key factors why IoT devices and networks require advanced security, and why they are seen as a prime target by criminals. The main reason is that IoT devices provide cyber criminals with access to sensitive data, systems, and networks, sometimes with minimal effort required.For example, a simple smart energy meter or thermostat may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that could be", "f180dc0d-0efc-461f-8a40-57cec49b6aa1": "(PII) that could be sold or distributed on the dark web. A worrying amount of data that traverses IoT devices is not encrypted. This means that if a device is compromised, an attacker has full control over this data.The second key factor why IoT cybersecurity is a significant concern is how difficult these devices can be to manage and install new security patches. Many IoT devices are deployed without any user interface or management software. This includes environmental sensors, industrial sensors, asset trackers, and of course, heart rate monitors.As a result, there is no simple method of implementing endpoint security or installing the latest security patches and updates.

By compromising just one over-privileged account, the attackers were able to access every camera on the network.The Mirai Botnet - The largest DDoS attack in historyGoing back to October 2016, the Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attack launched on the DNS service provider Dyn still ranks as the biggest attack of its type.Cybercriminals created a BotNet, installing malware on a large number of IoT devices.

This inventory should include all device configurations and the current status regarding when each device was last patched. In addition, the full network should be mapped out, clearly showing linked devices, making it easy to identify and manage vulnerabilities should there be a suspected breach.Security management processes also need to be put in place so that updates and patches can be installed regularly, with ongoing monitoring highlighting any devices that have outdated firmware.Security TestingOrganizations must conduct regular", "dc5a7a81-6aa2-42f1-98b8-d3b80280dc88": "conduct regular security assessments to identify new and existing vulnerabilities in the IoT network, including vulnerabilities within any software installed on devices.Findings from the assessments should be well-documented, with processes in place to resolve any issues along a prioritized and manageable timeline.

Devices should be observable at all times, including when they are running, highlighting suspicious behaviors without affecting the performance of the device.Monitoring software should feature a user-friendly dashboard, provide real-time alerts, and grant access to advanced analytics and reporting to highlight patterns within the huge amounts of data that are generated and processed by IoT devices.Adhere to the Latest Encryption ProtocolsEncryption is an essential component of IoT security so that even if a breach does occur, the data cannot be read or manipulated without the correct decryption key. All data, both stored", "83edc6d9-7f3c-414d-8a16-c0adab10db12": "data, both stored and in transit, must be protected using up-to-date encryption protocols. For IoT devices, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is recommended. In June 2003, AES became the default encryption algorithm for protecting classified information, including government information.Implement Network SegmentationNetwork segmentation is the dividing of a network into smaller, identifiable groups. By breaking down the network in this way, it becomes much easier to manage. If a breach occurs in a single segment, measures can be taken to stop it from spreading to other areas.IoT devices should always be within their separate segment, with different types of devices given their specific segments. This makes it possible to assign", "8637b7a1-fc1c-4456-bbe2-a4d66949282a": "possible to assign relevant access controls and create traffic rules. Controls and rules can then be quickly amended if any new threat intelligence relates to specific devices or user groups.Wrapping UpIoT devices can be found almost everywhere, from people\u2019s homes to hospitals and large industrial enterprises. Securing these devices can be challenging, especially if they are part of a large and complex network. Many IoT devices are not designed with security in mind, making it difficult to install the latest security patches and presenting an easy access point for cybercriminals to launch attacks.Fortunately, by adhering to five key protocols and practices, organizations can develop a robust IoT security strategy that minimizes the chance", "584b9643-3811-4d02-9c1a-85b118a59e2e": "the chance of a security breach and protects sensitive data. These five best practices include implementing tracking and management protocols, regular security assessments, real-time monitoring, using the latest encryption, and network segmentation.\u00a0About the Author:", "14c7b8a3-3850-4a0b-bd8f-189330c0177d": "Image\n \n\n\n\nSam Bocetta is a freelance journalist specializing in U.S. diplomacy and national security with an emphasis on technology trends in cyberwarfare, cyberdefense and cryptography.Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0The opinions expressed in this guest author article are solely those of the contributor and do not necessarily reflect those of Tripwire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet the Expert\nGuest Authors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Profile \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Solutions\n                \nCybersecurity\nSecurity Configuration Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related Content\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Blog\n            \n\nIoT Security Regulations: A Compliance Checklist \u2013 Part 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Blog", "206fc51e-040a-496c-b810-77519d0ea768": "IoT Security Regulations: A Compliance Checklist \u2013 Part 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  +1 800-328-1000\n Email Us\n Request Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX Find us on\n                              X\nLinkedIn Find us on\n                              LinkedIn\nYoutube Find us on\n                              Youtube\nReddit Find us on Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\n Products & Services\n \n\nTripwire Enterprise\n\n\nTripwire IP360\n\n\nTripwire LogCenter\n\n\nTripwire ExpertOps\n\n\nServices\n\n\nView All Products\n\n\nFortra Products\n\n\n\n\n Solutions\n \n\nBy Security Need\n\n\nBy Compliance Need\n\n\nBy Industry\n\n\n\n\n Resources\n \n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\nOn-Demand Webinars\n\n\nDatasheets\n\n\nTraining\n\n\nRequest a Quote\n\n\nStart a Demo\n\n\n\n\n About\n \n\nFortra\n\n\nPatents\n\n\nCustomer Support", "9617d99a-5767-4f24-aaf1-517c9467d807": "Customer Support\n\n\nReport a Vulnerability\n\n\n[email\u00a0protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Information\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\n\nImpressum\n                        Copyright \u00a9 Fortra, LLC and its group of companies.

It is clear that the healthcare industry is the new favorite target amongst cybercriminals. Fortunately, vigorous efforts are available to combat these threats. We recently spoke to Errol Weiss, Chief Security Officer at Health-ISAC. Errol spearheads the information sharing and analysis center, helping to make the healthcare sector better informed and more resilient.Tell us about how you became involved in the cybersecurity profession.I got interested in cybersecurity as a teen, reading about various computer heists and hacking. When I started my career with the National Security Agency, we tested systems at military bases and command", "9ee599d2-638c-4b74-a167-d539b0f4c6b1": "bases and command posts all over the world. The last job I had there was performing penetration testing on government systems. Some of my colleagues had left and worked for consulting companies, and although I wasn't actively looking for a new job, they convinced me to join them.I spent time working with some government contractors who were offering commercial security consulting. We were working with banks, insurance companies, and manufacturing companies at a time when the internet was just becoming popular and online banking was starting to develop. It was a matter of great timing for me to take the skills that I learned in the government and translate those into practical consulting services. Eventually, that rolled into an opportunity", "6533016a-f344-4105-8ce2-d8d05f3786de": "into an opportunity to work on the InfoSec team at Citibank. While I was there, they were looking to create a cyber threat intelligence function inside the bank, which was a fairly innovative concept at the time. This was back in 2008 when there weren't many commercial threat intelligence teams in existence. I helped create that function when I was at Citi and then headed that operation. By the time I left, we had 40 people working for that team in six different countries all around the globe. We had a 24x7 \"follow the sun operation\" built up from that.The experience I gained at Citi helped to roll ahead to my current position with the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Health-ISAC). I have been here for five years. I was", "940eb8c4-3bdc-4bc8-9da3-b200b6fa5f1c": "five years. I was recruited to help create the member-to-member sharing and threat intelligence functions that an ISAC offers. When you look at the basic functions of an information sharing and analysis center, it centers on the member-to-member sharing. I helped create the online systems that we use to foster that collaboration.All of the ISACs are different. This becomes evident when you look at the services that each one does. For example, some of what I learned while in the banking and finance sector and the Financial Services ISAC was they had a pretty robust internal team that was producing original threat intelligence. We wanted to replicate that in the health sector because we have a lot of organizations that can consume", "bc556678-2bca-466d-bcc0-337beaece45a": "that can consume intelligence but don't really understand how to do it, nor do they have the resources to purchase those kinds of commercial intelligence feeds. So, threat intelligence is a great basic function that we can provide for the industry. Health-ISAC's Threat Operations Center is headquartered in Orlando, Florida. In the past year, we've also hired two people in Europe, so we're starting to expand this team globally as well. The creation and expansion of that team was a big part of my job originally. Since the team has expanded, we've also hired an expert in medical device security.A lot of what we do inside Health-ISAC is also paying attention to what the medical device manufacturers are doing, looking at the issues,", "5845a3c6-54cb-414e-beca-d22f2c19d121": "at the issues, vulnerabilities, and threats in that space. We also hold regional events and workshops that we host for our members, including tabletop exercises. Health-ISAC provides all the technical expertise and background for running those kinds of events. There are a lot of great activities taking place to benefit the healthcare community.This year has been particularly busy, especially with the developments in the Change Healthcare incident back in February, and then the Ascension Hospital ransomware event in early May. We have been supporting our members with intelligence, practical advice, recommendations and other information that we can provide in terms of what we know about the incident, how it might've happened, and helping our", "be453b50-69f8-4cdc-a028-ad49088f49c1": "and helping our members to protect themselves from those kinds of threats.What are some of the biggest challenges when it comes to communicating with your members when there's been a breach?In an ideal world, when an incident happens, we would hope that our members can take the information from that incident to prevent an attack from occurring in their environments. Indicators of compromise, the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), or the ways that the malicious actor may have gotten into those systems, and what weaknesses they take advantage of in order to perpetrate that attack are all valuable to building better security and resilience.The ability to take all of that information and share it with the ISAC so that once it gets"}}
