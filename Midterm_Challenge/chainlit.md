- Premarket software functions guidance
- Quality Management Systems (QMS) requirements
- Reporting gaps in FDA-approved AI medical devices

### Cybersecurity Expertise
- Cybersecurity requirements for FDA submissions
- Pre-Market and Post-Market cybersecurity requirements
- NIST Cybersecurity framework implementation
- Risk management for software-based medical devices

## Example Questions

Try asking questions like:
- "What are the QMS requirements for SaMD?"
- "Do I need a new 510(k) submission when I update my machine learning model?"
- "What cybersecurity documentation do I need for FDA submission?"
- "How do I implement a Predetermined Change Control Plan for AI/ML updates?"
- "What are the current post-market cybersecurity requirements?"

## How It Works

This assistant uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide accurate information from FDA guidance documents, cybersecurity frameworks, and regulatory resources. It references actual regulatory documents to ensure advice is grounded in official guidance.

*Note: While this assistant provides regulatory information, it does not replace professional regulatory affairs consultation. Always verify critical regulatory decisions with qualified experts.*
