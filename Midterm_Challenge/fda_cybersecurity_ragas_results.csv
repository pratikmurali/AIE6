How does §524B(c) of the FD&C Act define a “cyber device”?,"['Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm0\n \n9 \n77812.htm).   \nThis guidance does not apply to investigational devices.11  \nIV. Definitions\xa0\nFor the purposes of this guidance, the following definitions are used: \nA. \n Compensating Controls \nA cybersecurity compensating control is a safeguard or countermeasure deployed, in lieu of, or in \nthe absence of controls designed in by a device manufacturer. These controls are external to the \ndevice design, configurable in the field, employed by a user, and provide supplementary or \ncomparable cyber protection for a medical device12. For example, a manufacturer’s assessment of \na cybersecurity vulnerability determines that unauthorized access to a networked medical device \nwill most likely impact the device’s safety or essential performance. However, the manufacturer \ndetermines that the device can safely and effectively operate without access to the host network, \nin this case the hospital network. The manufacturer instructs users to configure the network to \nremove the ability of unauthorized/unintended access to the device from the hospital network. \nThis type of counter measure is an example of a compensating control. \n  \nB. \nControlled Risk \nControlled risk is present when there is sufficiently low (acceptable) residual risk of patient harm \ndue to a device’s particular cybersecurity vulnerability. \nC. Cybersecurity Routine Updates and Patches \nCybersecurity “routine updates and patches” are changes to a device to increase device security \nand/or remediate only those vulnerabilities associated with controlled risk of patient harm. These \ntypes of changes are not to reduce uncontrolled risk of patient harm, and therefore not to reduce a \nrisk to health or to correct a violation of the FD&C Act. They include any regularly scheduled \nsecurity updates or patches to a device, including upgrades to the software, firmware, \nprogrammable logic, hardware, or security of a device to increase device security, as well as \nupdates or patches to address vulnerabilities associated with controlled risk performed earlier than \ntheir regularly scheduled deployment cycle even if they are distributed to multiple units. \nCybersecurity routine updates and patches are generally considered to be a type of device \nenhancement that may be applied to vulnerabilities associated with controlled risk and is not \nconsidered a repair. Cybersecurity routine updates and patches may also include changes to \n                                                 \n11 Manufacturers may also consider applying the cybersecurity principles described in this guidance as appropriate to \nInvestigational Device Exemption submissions and to devices exempt from premarket review.  \n12 This definition is adapted from NIST Special Publication “Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal \nInformation Systems and Organizations,” NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 4.', 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 3 \nThis guidance applies to all types of devices within the meaning of section 201(h) of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), including devices that meet the definition of a \nbiological product under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, whether or not they \nrequire a premarket submission. Therefore, the recommendations in this guidance also apply to \ndevices for which a premarket submission is not required (e.g., for 510(k)-exempt devices). This \nguidance also applies to cyber devices, as defined in section 524B of the FD&C Act, which are a \nsubset of devices.  \n \nGenerally, the recommendations in this guidance apply to the device constituent part of a \ncombination product5 (such as drug-device and biologic-device combination products) when the \ndevice constituent part presents cybersecurity considerations,6 including but not limited to \ndevices that that have a device software function or that contain software (including firmware) or \nprogrammable logic. For more information, contact the FDA review division that will have the \nlead review for the combination product.7 \n \nAs IDE submissions have a different benefit-risk threshold and are not marketing authorizations, \nspecific recommendations for IDE submission documentation are provided in Appendix 3. \nAdditionally, Appendix 5 contains terminology used throughout the guidance. \n \nIII. Background  \nFDA recognizes that medical device cybersecurity is a shared responsibility among stakeholders \nthroughout the use environment of the medical device system, including healthcare facilities, \npatients, healthcare providers, and manufacturers of medical devices. For the purposes of this \nguidance, the term “medical device system” includes the device and systems—such as healthcare \nfacility networks, other devices, and software update servers—to which it is connected. \n \nEvents across the healthcare sector have stressed the importance of cybersecurity to patient \nsafety. The WannaCry8 ransomware9 affected hospital systems and medical devices across the \nglobe. Vulnerabilities identified in commonly used third-party components, like URGENT/1110 \nand SweynTooth,11 have led to potential safety concerns across a broad range of devices that are \n \n5 21 CFR 3.2(e). \n6 21 CFR 4.2. \n7 This guidance has been prepared by CDRH and CBER, in consultation with the Center for Drug Evaluation and \nResearch (CDER) and the Office of Combination Products (OCP). \n8 Additional information on the WannaCry Ransomware attack is available at https://h-isac.org/may-16-2017-\nwannacry-update/  \n9 For the purposes of this guidance, we consider “ransomware” an ever-evolving form of malware designed to \nencrypt files on a device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them unusable.

General Principles \nThis section provides general principles for device cybersecurity relevant to device \nmanufacturers. The principles in this guidance document are important to the improvement of \ndevice cybersecurity and, when followed, are expected to have a positive impact on the safety \nand effectiveness of the device. The recommendations in this guidance cover all relevant \ncybersecurity considerations that may affect device safety and effectiveness, including but not \nlimited to software, hardware, and firmware.  \nA. \nCybersecurity is Part of Device Safety and the Quality \nSystem Regulation \nDevice manufacturers must establish and follow quality systems to help ensure that their \nproducts consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications.

For a small subset of actions taken by manufacturers to correct \ndevice cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exploits that may pose a risk to health, the FDA would \nrequire medical device manufacturers to notify the Agency.3 Risks to health posed by the device \nmay result in patient harm. This guidance recommends how to assess whether the risk4 of patient \nharm is sufficiently controlled or uncontrolled. This assessment is based on an evaluation of the \nlikelihood of exploit, the impact of exploitation on the device’s safety and essential performance,5 \nand the severity of patient harm if exploited. \nThis document is not intended to provide guidance on reporting to FDA when a device has or may \nhave caused or contributed to a death or serious injury as required by section 519 of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) \nRegulation in 21 CFR part 803. For an explanation of the current reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements applicable to manufacturers of medical devices, please refer to the Medical Device \nReporting for Manufacturers Guidance \n(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM\n359566).  \nFor the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the \nFDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database Web site at  \nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm . \nFDA's guidance documents, including this final guidance, do not establish legally enforceable \nresponsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should \nbe viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are \ncited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or \nrecommended, but not required.  \nII.
