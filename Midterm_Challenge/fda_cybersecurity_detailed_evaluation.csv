Definitions\xa0\nFor the purposes of this guidance, the following definitions are used: \nA. \n Compensating Controls \nA cybersecurity compensating control is a safeguard or countermeasure deployed, in lieu of, or in \nthe absence of controls designed in by a device manufacturer. These controls are external to the \ndevice design, configurable in the field, employed by a user, and provide supplementary or \ncomparable cyber protection for a medical device12. For example, a manufacturer’s assessment of \na cybersecurity vulnerability determines that unauthorized access to a networked medical device \nwill most likely impact the device’s safety or essential performance. However, the manufacturer \ndetermines that the device can safely and effectively operate without access to the host network, \nin this case the hospital network. The manufacturer instructs users to configure the network to \nremove the ability of unauthorized/unintended access to the device from the hospital network. \nThis type of counter measure is an example of a compensating control. \n  \nB. \nControlled Risk \nControlled risk is present when there is sufficiently low (acceptable) residual risk of patient harm \ndue to a device’s particular cybersecurity vulnerability. \nC. Cybersecurity Routine Updates and Patches \nCybersecurity “routine updates and patches” are changes to a device to increase device security \nand/or remediate only those vulnerabilities associated with controlled risk of patient harm. These \ntypes of changes are not to reduce uncontrolled risk of patient harm, and therefore not to reduce a \nrisk to health or to correct a violation of the FD&C Act. They include any regularly scheduled \nsecurity updates or patches to a device, including upgrades to the software, firmware, \nprogrammable logic, hardware, or security of a device to increase device security, as well as \nupdates or patches to address vulnerabilities associated with controlled risk performed earlier than \ntheir regularly scheduled deployment cycle even if they are distributed to multiple units. \nCybersecurity routine updates and patches are generally considered to be a type of device \nenhancement that may be applied to vulnerabilities associated with controlled risk and is not \nconsidered a repair. Cybersecurity routine updates and patches may also include changes to \n                                                 \n11 Manufacturers may also consider applying the cybersecurity principles described in this guidance as appropriate to \nInvestigational Device Exemption submissions and to devices exempt from premarket review.  \n12 This definition is adapted from NIST Special Publication “Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal \nInformation Systems and Organizations,” NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 4.'
 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 3 \nThis guidance applies to all types of devices within the meaning of section 201(h) of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), including devices that meet the definition of a \nbiological product under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, whether or not they \nrequire a premarket submission. Therefore, the recommendations in this guidance also apply to \ndevices for which a premarket submission is not required (e.g., for 510(k)-exempt devices). This \nguidance also applies to cyber devices, as defined in section 524B of the FD&C Act, which are a \nsubset of devices.  \n \nGenerally, the recommendations in this guidance apply to the device constituent part of a \ncombination product5 (such as drug-device and biologic-device combination products) when the \ndevice constituent part presents cybersecurity considerations,6 including but not limited to \ndevices that that have a device software function or that contain software (including firmware) or \nprogrammable logic. For more information, contact the FDA review division that will have the \nlead review for the combination product.7 \n \nAs IDE submissions have a different benefit-risk threshold and are not marketing authorizations, \nspecific recommendations for IDE submission documentation are provided in Appendix 3. \nAdditionally, Appendix 5 contains terminology used throughout the guidance. \n \nIII. Background  \nFDA recognizes that medical device cybersecurity is a shared responsibility among stakeholders \nthroughout the use environment of the medical device system, including healthcare facilities, \npatients, healthcare providers, and manufacturers of medical devices. For the purposes of this \nguidance, the term “medical device system” includes the device and systems—such as healthcare \nfacility networks, other devices, and software update servers—to which it is connected. \n \nEvents across the healthcare sector have stressed the importance of cybersecurity to patient \nsafety. The WannaCry8 ransomware9 affected hospital systems and medical devices across the \nglobe. Vulnerabilities identified in commonly used third-party components, like URGENT/1110 \nand SweynTooth,11 have led to potential safety concerns across a broad range of devices that are \n \n5 21 CFR 3.2(e). \n6 21 CFR 4.2. \n7 This guidance has been prepared by CDRH and CBER, in consultation with the Center for Drug Evaluation and \nResearch (CDER) and the Office of Combination Products (OCP). \n8 Additional information on the WannaCry Ransomware attack is available at https://h-isac.org/may-16-2017-\nwannacry-update/  \n9 For the purposes of this guidance, we consider “ransomware” an ever-evolving form of malware designed to \nencrypt files on a device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them unusable.

For more information on \nSPDFs, see earlier in Section V. In addition, FDA does not recommend that manufacturers \ndiscontinue existing, effective processes. \nA. \nSecurity Risk Management \nTo fully account for cybersecurity risks in medical device systems, the safety and security risks \nof each device should be assessed within the context of the larger system in which the device \noperates. In the context of cybersecurity, security risk management processes are critical \nbecause, given the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats and risks, no device is, or can be, \ncompletely secure. Security risk management should be an integrated part of a manufacturer’s \nentire quality system, addressed throughout the TPLC.32 The quality system processes entail the \ntechnical, personnel, and management practices, among others, that manufacturers use to manage \npotential risks to their devices and ensure that their devices are, and once on the market, remain, \nsafe and effective, which includes security.  \n \nPerforming security risk management is distinct from performing safety risk management as \ndescribed in ISO 14971. The distinction in the performance of these processes is due to the fact \nthat in the security context versus the safety context, the scope of possible harm and the risk \nassessment factors may be different. Also, while safety risk management focuses on physical \ninjury, damage to property or the environment, or delay and/or denial of care due to device or \nsystem unavailability, security risk management may include risks that can result in indirect or \ndirect patient harm. Additionally, risks that are outside of FDA’s assessment of safety and \neffectiveness, such as those related to business or reputational risks, may also exist.  \n \nThe scope and objective of a security risk management process, in conjunction with other SPDF \nprocesses (e.g., security testing), is to expose how threats, through vulnerabilities, can manifest \npatient harm and other potential risks. These processes should also ensure that risk control \nmeasures for one type of risk assessment do not inadvertently introduce new risks in the other. \nFor example, AAMI TIR57 details how the security and safety risk management processes \nshould interface to ensure all risks are adequately assessed.33 FDA recommends that security risk \nmanagement processes, as detailed in the QS regulation,34 be established or incorporated into \nthose that already exist, and should address the manufacturer’s design, manufacturing, and \ndistribution processes, as well as updates across the TPLC. The processes in the QS regulation \nwhich may be relevant in this context include, but are not limited to design controls (21 CFR \n820.30), validation of production processes (21 CFR 820.70), and corrective and preventive \nactions (21 CFR 820.100) to ensure both safety and security risks are adequately addressed. For \ncompleteness in performing risk analyses under 21 CFR 820.30(g), FDA recommends that \ndevice manufacturers conduct both a safety risk assessment and a separate, accompanying \nsecurity risk assessment to ensure a more comprehensive identification and management of \npatient safety risks.  \n \n32 The TPLC processes include design and development, manufacturing, postmarket monitoring, delivering device \nsoftware and firmware updates, and servicing, among others.  \n33 AAMI TIR57 Principles for medical device security—Risk management describes the security risk management \nprocess and how the security risk management process should have links into the safety risk management process \nand vice versa.  \n34 21 CFR 820.'
 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 10 \nFor cyber devices, some of the information recommended in this guidance may help \nmanufacturers meet their obligations for what is required to be in premarket submissions under \nsection 524B.  \nV. Using an SPDF to Manage Cybersecurity Risks \nThe documentation recommended in this guidance is based on FDA’s experience evaluating the \nsafety and effectiveness of devices with cybersecurity vulnerabilities. However, sponsors may \nuse alternative approaches and provide different documentation so long as their approach and \ndocumentation satisfy premarket submission requirements in applicable statutory provisions and \nregulations. The increasingly interconnected nature of medical devices has demonstrated the \nimportance of addressing cybersecurity risks associated with device connectivity in device \ndesign because of the effects on safety and effectiveness.28 Cybersecurity risks to the medical \ndevice or to the larger medical device system can be reasonably controlled through using an \nSPDF. \n \nThe primary goal of using an SPDF is to manufacture and maintain safe and effective devices. \nFrom a security standpoint, these are also trustworthy and resilient devices. These devices can \nthen be managed (e.g., installed, configured, updated, review of device logs) through the device \ndesign and associated labeling by the device manufacturers and/or users (e.g., patients, \nhealthcare facilities). For healthcare facilities, these devices can also be managed within their \nown cybersecurity risk management frameworks, such as the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, generally \nreferred to as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework or NIST CSF.29  \n \nFDA recommends that manufacturers use device design processes such as those described in the \nQS regulation to support secure product development and maintenance. To preserve flexibility \nfor manufacturers, manufacturers may use other existing frameworks that satisfy the QS \nregulation and align with FDA’s recommendations for using an SPDF. Possible frameworks to \nconsider include, but are not limited to the medical device-specific framework that can be found \nin the Medical Device and Health IT Joint Security Plan (JSP) 30 and IEC 81001-5-1. \nFrameworks from other sectors may also comply with the QS regulations, like the framework \nprovided in ANSI/ISA 62443-4-1 Security for industrial automation and control systems Part 4-\n1: Product security development life-cycle requirements.31 \n \nThe following subsections provide recommendations for using SPDF processes that FDA \nbelieves provide important considerations for the development of devices that are safe and \neffective, how these processes can complement the QS regulation, and the documentation FDA \nrecommends manufacturers provide for review as part of premarket submissions.

The security objectives below \ngenerally may apply broadly to devices within the scope of this guidance, including, but not \nlimited to, devices containing artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) and cloud-\nbased services. \n \nSecurity Objectives: \n• Authenticity, which includes integrity;  \n• Authorization;  \n• Availability;  \n• Confidentiality; and  \n• Secure and timely updatability and patchability.  \n \nPremarket submissions should include information that describes how the above security \nobjectives are addressed by and integrated into the device design. The extent to which security \nrequirements, architecture, supply chain, and implementation are needed to meet these objectives \nwill depend on but may not be limited to: \n  \n• The device’s intended use, indications for use, and reasonably foreseeable misuse;  \n• The presence and functionality of its electronic data interfaces;  \n• Its intended and actual environment of use;24  \n• The risks presented by cybersecurity vulnerabilities;  \n• The exploitability of the vulnerabilities; and  \n• The risk of patient harm due to vulnerability exploitation. \n \n \n24 Manufacturers may not be able to account for all potential environments of use, but should consider the range of \nuse environments and ensure the risks are identified and controlled for the worst-case environments of use (e.g., \nleast secure expected network configuration(s)).'
 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 19 \nFor example, a clinical user may inadvertently reveal the presence of a previously unknown \nsoftware anomaly during normal use, where the impact of the anomaly might occur sporadically \nand be assessed to be acceptable from a software risk perspective. Conversely, a threat might \nseek out these types of anomalies, and identify means to exploit them in order to manifest the \nanomaly’s impact continuously, which could significantly impact the acceptability of the risk \nwhen compared to an anomaly assessment that didn’t include security considerations. \n \nThe criteria and rationales for addressing the resulting anomalies with security impacts should be \nprovided as part of documentation in the premarket submission. \n \n6. \nTPLC Security Risk Management \nCybersecurity risks may continue to be identified throughout the device’s TPLC. Manufacturers \nshould ensure they have appropriate resources to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity \nvulnerabilities as they are identified throughout the supported device lifecycle.  \n \nAs part of using an SPDF, manufacturers should update their security risk management \ndocumentation as new information becomes available, such as when new threats, vulnerabilities, \nassets, or adverse impacts are discovered during development and after the device is released. \nWhen maintained throughout the device lifecycle, this documentation (e.g., threat modeling) can \nbe used to quickly identify vulnerability impacts once a device is released and, when appropriate, \nto support timely corrective and preventive action activities described in 21 CFR 820.100.  \n \nOver the service life of a device, FDA recommends that the risk management documentation \naccount for any differences in the risk management for fielded devices (e.g., marketed devices or \ndevices no longer marketed but still in use). For example, if an update is not applied \nautomatically for all fielded devices, then there will likely be different risk profiles for differing \nsoftware configurations of the device. FDA recommends that vulnerabilities be assessed for any \ndiffering impacts for all fielded versions to ensure patient risks are being accurately assessed. \nAdditional information as to whether a new premarket submission (e.g., PMA, PMA supplement, \nor 510(k)) or 21 CFR Part 806 reporting is needed based on postmarket vulnerabilities and \ngeneral postmarket cybersecurity risk management is discussed in the Postmarket Cybersecurity \nGuidance.  \n \nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of a manufacturer’s processes, FDA recommends that a \nmanufacturer track and record the measures and metrics below,53 and provide them in premarket \nsubmissions and PMA annual reports (21 CFR 814.84), when available.54 Selecting appropriate \nmeasures and metrics for the processes that define an SPDF is important to ensure that device \ndesign appropriately addresses cybersecurity in compliance with the QS regulation. At a \nminimum, FDA recommends tracking the following measures and metrics, or those that provide \nequivalent information: \n \n \n53 The measures and metrics provided are examples; alternative or additional measures and metrics may also be \nconsidered and reported.  \n54 If a manufacturer has not marketed prior versions or the premarket submission does not pertain to a marketed \nproduct (e.g., PMA supplement), FDA acknowledges that these measures and metrics might not be available, but \nrecommends that manufacturers include these as part of their risk management plan and SPDF processes.']","The Secure Product Development Framework (SPDF) explicitly covers all aspects of a product's lifecycle, including design, development, release, support, and decommission.

 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 8 \nSPDF processes aim to reduce the number and severity of vulnerabilities and thereby reduce the \nexploitability of a medical device system and the associated risk of patient harm. Because \nexploitation of known vulnerabilities or weak cybersecurity controls should be considered \nreasonably foreseeable failure modes for medical device systems, these factors should be \naddressed in the device design.25 One of the key benefits of using an SPDF is that a medical \ndevice system is more likely to be secure by design, such that the device is designed from the \noutset to be secure within its system and/or network of use throughout the device lifecycle. \nC. \nTransparency \nA lack of cybersecurity information, such as information necessary to integrate the device into \nthe use environment, as well as information needed by users to maintain the medical device \nsystem’s cybersecurity over the device lifecycle, has the potential to affect the safety and \neffectiveness of a device. In order to address these concerns, it is important for device users to \nhave access to information pertaining to the device’s cybersecurity controls, potential risks to the \nmedical device system, and other relevant information. For example: \n \n• A failure to disclose all of the communication interfaces or third-party software could fail \nto convey potential sources of risks; \n• Insufficient information pertaining to whether a device has known but not disclosed \ncybersecurity vulnerabilities or risks may be relevant to determining whether a device’s \nsafety or effectiveness could be degraded; and/or \n• Labeling that does not include sufficient information to explain how to securely configure \nor update the device may limit the ability of end users to appropriately manage and \nprotect the medical device system.  \n \nThis information and other relevant information are important in helping users understand a \nmedical device system’s resilience to cybersecurity threats, the threats that it may be exposed to, \nand how those threats may be prevented or mitigated. Without it, cybersecurity risks could be \nundisclosed, inappropriately identified, or inappropriately responded to, among other potential \nimpacts, which could lead to compromises in device safety and effectiveness. \n \nFDA believes that the cybersecurity information discussed in this guidance is important for the \nsafe and effective use of devices and should be included in device labeling, as discussed below in \nSection VI.  \nD. \nSubmission Documentation \nDevice cybersecurity design and documentation are expected to scale with the cybersecurity risk \nof that device. Manufacturers should take into account the larger system in which the device may \nbe used. For example, a cybersecurity risk assessment performed on a simple, non-connected \nthermometer may conclude that the risks are limited, and therefore such a device needs only a \nlimited security architecture (i.e., addressing only device hardware and software) and few \nsecurity controls based on the technical characteristics and design of the device.

In addition, FDA does not recommend that manufacturers \ndiscontinue existing, effective processes. \nA. \nSecurity Risk Management \nTo fully account for cybersecurity risks in medical device systems, the safety and security risks \nof each device should be assessed within the context of the larger system in which the device \noperates. In the context of cybersecurity, security risk management processes are critical \nbecause, given the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats and risks, no device is, or can be, \ncompletely secure. Security risk management should be an integrated part of a manufacturer’s \nentire quality system, addressed throughout the TPLC.32 The quality system processes entail the \ntechnical, personnel, and management practices, among others, that manufacturers use to manage \npotential risks to their devices and ensure that their devices are, and once on the market, remain, \nsafe and effective, which includes security.  \n \nPerforming security risk management is distinct from performing safety risk management as \ndescribed in ISO 14971. The distinction in the performance of these processes is due to the fact \nthat in the security context versus the safety context, the scope of possible harm and the risk \nassessment factors may be different. Also, while safety risk management focuses on physical \ninjury, damage to property or the environment, or delay and/or denial of care due to device or \nsystem unavailability, security risk management may include risks that can result in indirect or \ndirect patient harm. Additionally, risks that are outside of FDA’s assessment of safety and \neffectiveness, such as those related to business or reputational risks, may also exist.  \n \nThe scope and objective of a security risk management process, in conjunction with other SPDF \nprocesses (e.g., security testing), is to expose how threats, through vulnerabilities, can manifest \npatient harm and other potential risks. These processes should also ensure that risk control \nmeasures for one type of risk assessment do not inadvertently introduce new risks in the other. \nFor example, AAMI TIR57 details how the security and safety risk management processes \nshould interface to ensure all risks are adequately assessed.33 FDA recommends that security risk \nmanagement processes, as detailed in the QS regulation,34 be established or incorporated into \nthose that already exist, and should address the manufacturer’s design, manufacturing, and \ndistribution processes, as well as updates across the TPLC. The processes in the QS regulation \nwhich may be relevant in this context include, but are not limited to design controls (21 CFR \n820.30), validation of production processes (21 CFR 820.70), and corrective and preventive \nactions (21 CFR 820.100) to ensure both safety and security risks are adequately addressed. For \ncompleteness in performing risk analyses under 21 CFR 820.30(g), FDA recommends that \ndevice manufacturers conduct both a safety risk assessment and a separate, accompanying \nsecurity risk assessment to ensure a more comprehensive identification and management of \npatient safety risks.  \n \n32 The TPLC processes include design and development, manufacturing, postmarket monitoring, delivering device \nsoftware and firmware updates, and servicing, among others.  \n33 AAMI TIR57 Principles for medical device security—Risk management describes the security risk management \nprocess and how the security risk management process should have links into the safety risk management process \nand vice versa.  \n34 21 CFR 820.']","The primary goal of using a Secure Product Development Framework (SPDF) for medical devices is to manufacture and maintain safe and effective devices.

 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 14 \n2. \nCybersecurity Risk Assessment \nAs a part of security risk management, security risks and controls should be assessed for residual \nrisks as part of a cybersecurity risk assessment. Effective security risk assessments address the \nfact that cybersecurity-related failures can occur either intentionally or unintentionally. \nAccordingly, cybersecurity risks are difficult to predict, meaning that it is not possible to assess \nand quantify the likelihood of an incident occurring based on historical data or modeling (also \nknown as a “probabilistic manner”). This non-probabilistic approach is not the fundamental \napproach performed in safety risk management under ISO 14971 and further underscores why \nsafety and security risk management are distinct but connected processes. Instead, security risk \nassessment processes focus on exploitability, or the ability to exploit vulnerabilities present \nwithin a device and/or system. FDA recommends that manufacturers assess identified risks \naccording to the level of risk posed from the device and the system in which it operates. \nAdditional discussion on exploitability assessments for the security risk assessment can be found \nin the FDA’s Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance. \n \nThe premarket assessment of exploitability of a cybersecurity risk may be different from the \nexploitability assessment of a vulnerability discovered postmarket. For example, some of the \nexploitability factors discussed in the Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance (e.g., Exploit Code \nMaturity, Remediation Level, Report Confidence)39 may not be applicable to unreleased \nsoftware. In these instances, a premarket exploitability assessment could either assume a worst-\ncase assessment and implement appropriate controls, or provide a justification for a reasonable \nexploitability assessment of the risk throughout the TPLC and how the risk is controlled.  \n \nAcceptance criteria for cybersecurity risks should carefully consider the TPLC of the medical \ndevice system, as it might be more difficult to mitigate cybersecurity issues once the device is \nmarketed. As discussed above in Sections IV.B. and V.A., known vulnerabilities should be \nassessed as reasonably foreseeable risks. The cybersecurity risk assessment for vulnerabilities \nidentified during cybersecurity testing should also consider the TPLC of the device as the \nexploitability of the vulnerability is likely to increase over the device lifecycle. If a vulnerability \nscan or penetration tester, for example, was able to exploit a vulnerability, the ability of a threat \nactor to exploit that vulnerability is likely to increase over the device lifecycle. Furthermore, \nvulnerabilities identified in Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Known \nExploited Vulnerabilities Catalog40 should be designed out of the device, as they are already \nbeing exploited and expose the medical device system and users to the risk. \n \nFDA recommends that the cybersecurity risk assessment provided in premarket submissions \nshould capture the risks and controls identified from the threat model.

PPD-21 encourages all public and private stakeholders to share responsibility in achieving \nthese outcomes. \nIn recognition of the shared responsibility for cybersecurity, the security industry has established \nresources including standards, guidelines, best practices and frameworks for stakeholders to adopt \na culture of cybersecurity risk management. Best practices include collaboratively assessing \ncybersecurity intelligence information for risks to device functionality and clinical risk. FDA \nbelieves that, in alignment with EO 13636 and PPD-21, public and private stakeholders should \ncollaborate to leverage available resources and tools to establish a common understanding that \nassesses risks for identified vulnerabilities in medical devices among the information technology \ncommunity, healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs), the clinical user community, and the \nmedical device community. These collaborations can lead to the consistent assessment and \nmitigation of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, and their impact on medical devices, \nultimately reducing potential risk of patient harm.   \nCybersecurity risk management is a shared responsibility among stakeholders including the \nmedical device manufacturer, the user, the Information Technology (IT) system integrator, Health \nIT developers, and an array of IT vendors that provide products that are not regulated by the FDA. \nFDA seeks to encourage collaboration among stakeholders by clarifying, for those stakeholders it \nregulates, recommendations associated with mitigating cybersecurity threats to device \nfunctionality and device users.  \nAs stated in the FDA guidance document titled “Content of Premarket Submissions for \nManagement of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices” \n(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM\n356190), when manufacturers consider cybersecurity during the design phases of the medical \ndevice lifecycle, the resulting impact is a more proactive and robust mitigation of cybersecurity \nrisks. Similarly, a proactive and risk-based approach to the postmarket phase for medical devices, \nthrough engaging in cybersecurity information sharing and monitoring, promoting “good cyber \nhygiene” through routine device cyber maintenance, assessing postmarket information, employing \na risk-based approach to characterizing vulnerabilities, and timely implementation of necessary \nactions can further mitigate emerging cybersecurity risks and reduce the impact to patients.  \nTo further aid manufacturers in managing their cybersecurity risk, the Agency encourages the use \nand adoption of the voluntary “Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity” \n(https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cyberframework/cybersecurity-framework-\n021214.pdf) that has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology \n(NIST) with collective input from other government agencies and the private sector.'

In 2020, a ransomware attack on a German hospital \nhighlighted the potential impacts due to delayed patient care when a cybersecurity attack forced \npatients to be diverted to another hospital.12 \n \nFDA issued a final cybersecurity guidance addressing premarket expectations in 2014 “Content \nof Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices,” and the \ncomplementary guidance “Postmarket Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices,”13 \nhereafter referred to as the “Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance,” in 2016. However, the rapidly \nevolving landscape, an increased understanding of emerging threats, and the need for capable \ndeployment of mitigations throughout the total product lifecycle (TPLC) warrants an updated, \niterative approach to device cybersecurity. The changes since the 2014 guidance are intended to \nfurther emphasize the importance of ensuring that devices are designed securely, are designed to \nbe capable of mitigating emerging cybersecurity risks throughout the TPLC, and to more clearly \noutline FDA’s recommendations for premarket submission information to address cybersecurity \nconcerns.  \n \nOne way these TPLC considerations for devices can be achieved is through the implementation \nand adoption of a Secure Product Development Framework (SPDF).14 An SPDF, as described in \nthis guidance, is a set of processes that reduce the number and severity of vulnerabilities in \nproducts throughout the device lifecycle. Examples of such frameworks exist in many sectors \nincluding the medical device sector.  \n \nRisk management for device manufacturers is the essential systematic practice of identifying, \nanalyzing, evaluating, controlling, and monitoring risk throughout the product lifecycle to ensure \nthat the devices they manufacture are safe and effective. The Quality System (QS) regulation in \n21 CFR Part 820 explicitly addresses risk management activities in 21 CFR 820.30(g). Although \nFDA is currently in the process of rulemaking15 to revise the QS regulation, including 21 CFR \n820.30(g), should FDA finalize the rule as proposed, the concept of risk management as \ndescribed in 21 CFR 820.30(g) would remain. \n \nThe recommendations contained in this guidance document are intended to supplement FDA’s \nPostmarket Cybersecurity Guidance, “Cybersecurity for Networked Medical Devices Containing \n \n12 Additional information on the German hospital ransomware attack is available at \nhttps://www.wired.co.uk/article/ransomware-hospital-death-germany  \n13 Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/postmarket-\nmanagement-cybersecurity-medical-devices  \n14 See Appendix 5, Terminology.  \n15 On February 23, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to amend the device QS regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, to align \nmore closely with international consensus standards for devices (87 FR 10119; available at \nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/02/23/2022-03227/medical-devices-quality-system-regulation-\namendments).

 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 10 \nFor cyber devices, some of the information recommended in this guidance may help \nmanufacturers meet their obligations for what is required to be in premarket submissions under \nsection 524B.  \nV. Using an SPDF to Manage Cybersecurity Risks \nThe documentation recommended in this guidance is based on FDA’s experience evaluating the \nsafety and effectiveness of devices with cybersecurity vulnerabilities. However, sponsors may \nuse alternative approaches and provide different documentation so long as their approach and \ndocumentation satisfy premarket submission requirements in applicable statutory provisions and \nregulations. The increasingly interconnected nature of medical devices has demonstrated the \nimportance of addressing cybersecurity risks associated with device connectivity in device \ndesign because of the effects on safety and effectiveness.28 Cybersecurity risks to the medical \ndevice or to the larger medical device system can be reasonably controlled through using an \nSPDF. \n \nThe primary goal of using an SPDF is to manufacture and maintain safe and effective devices. \nFrom a security standpoint, these are also trustworthy and resilient devices. These devices can \nthen be managed (e.g., installed, configured, updated, review of device logs) through the device \ndesign and associated labeling by the device manufacturers and/or users (e.g., patients, \nhealthcare facilities). For healthcare facilities, these devices can also be managed within their \nown cybersecurity risk management frameworks, such as the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, generally \nreferred to as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework or NIST CSF.29  \n \nFDA recommends that manufacturers use device design processes such as those described in the \nQS regulation to support secure product development and maintenance. To preserve flexibility \nfor manufacturers, manufacturers may use other existing frameworks that satisfy the QS \nregulation and align with FDA’s recommendations for using an SPDF. Possible frameworks to \nconsider include, but are not limited to the medical device-specific framework that can be found \nin the Medical Device and Health IT Joint Security Plan (JSP) 30 and IEC 81001-5-1. \nFrameworks from other sectors may also comply with the QS regulations, like the framework \nprovided in ANSI/ISA 62443-4-1 Security for industrial automation and control systems Part 4-\n1: Product security development life-cycle requirements.31 \n \nThe following subsections provide recommendations for using SPDF processes that FDA \nbelieves provide important considerations for the development of devices that are safe and \neffective, how these processes can complement the QS regulation, and the documentation FDA \nrecommends manufacturers provide for review as part of premarket submissions. The \n \n28 Addressing cybersecurity risks is in addition to addressing other risks, including software, biocompatibility, \nsterilization, and electromagnetic compatibility, among others. \n29 For more information, please see the NIST Cybersecurity Framework available at \nhttps://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  \n30 Medical Device and Health IT Joint Security Plan (JSP) is available at https://healthsectorcouncil.org/the-joint-\nsecurity-plan/ \n31 ANSI/ISA-62443-4-1 Security for industrial automation and control systems Part 4-1: Product security \ndevelopment life-cycle requirements outlines a secure product development lifecycle similar to that of the JSP.'
 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n· Adopting a coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy and practice. The FDA has \nrecognized ISO/IEC 29147:2014: Information Technology – Security Techniques – \nVulnerability Disclosure which may be a useful resource for manufacturers; and \n· Deploying mitigations that address cybersecurity risk early and prior to exploitation. \nPostmarket cybersecurity information may originate from an array of sources including \nindependent security researchers, in-house testing, suppliers of software or hardware technology, \nhealth care facilities, and information sharing and analysis organizations. It is strongly \nrecommended that manufacturers participate in an ISAO that shares vulnerabilities and threats \nthat impact medical devices. Sharing and dissemination of cybersecurity information and \nintelligence pertaining to vulnerabilities and threats across multiple sectors is integral to a \nsuccessful postmarket cybersecurity surveillance program. \nTo manage postmarket cybersecurity risks for medical devices, a company should have a \nstructured and systematic approach to risk management and quality management systems \nconsistent with 21 CFR part 820. For example, such a program should include: \n· Methods to identify, characterize, and assess a cybersecurity vulnerability.  \n· Methods to analyze, detect, and assess threat sources.  For example: \no A cybersecurity vulnerability might impact all of the medical devices in a \nmanufacturer’s portfolio based on how their products are developed; or \no A cybersecurity vulnerability could exist vertically (i.e., within the \ncomponents of a device) which can be introduced at any point in the supply \nchain for a medical device manufacturing process. \nIt is recommended as part of a manufacturer’s cybersecurity risk management program \nthat the manufacturer incorporate elements consistent with the NIST Framework for \nImproving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (i.e., Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, \nand Recover; \nhttps://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cyberframework/cybersecurity-\n \n14 \nframework-021214.pdf ).   \nFDA recognizes that medical devices and the surrounding network infrastructure cannot be \ncompletely secured. Design, architecture, technology, and software development environment \nchoices may result in the inadvertent incorporation of vulnerabilities. The presence of a \nvulnerability does not necessarily trigger patient harm concerns. Rather it is the impact of the \nvulnerability on the safety and essential performance of the device which may present a risk of \npatient harm. Vulnerabilities that do not appear to currently present a risk of patient harm should \nbe assessed by the manufacturer for future impact.  \nC.

These could range from \ndiminishing patients’ trust in the security of the healthcare system to hesitancy towards using these \nAI medical devices due to their cybersecurity-related vulnerabilities.4  \n \nThe chapter is divided into three parts. The first part starts by setting the scene where we explain the \nrole of cybersecurity in healthcare. Then, we briefly define what we refer to when we talk about AI \nthat is considered a medical device by itself or supports one.5 To illustrate the risks such medical \ndevices pose, we provide three examples: the poisoning of datasets, social engineering, and data or \nsource code extraction. In the second part, the paper provides an overview of the European Union \n \n* All the authors equally contributed to the writing process of this book chapter. \n \n1 For the ethical cybersecurity issues in healthcare, see Markus Christen, Bert Gordijn and Michele Loi (eds), The Ethics of \nCybersecurity, vol 21 (Springer International Publishing 2020) <http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-29053-5> , \nchapter 7. \n2 In this book chapter, we refer to ‘AI as or in medical devices’ following the caveats explained under section ‘AI in or as \nmedical devices’; see infra; Contrary to the EU, the United States’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses definitions of \n“Software as Medical Devices” as defined by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMRDF), see International \nMedical Device Regulators Forum, ‘""Software as a Medical Device"": Possible Framework for Risk Categorization and \nCorresponding Considerations’ (2014).

For critical analysis of this, see, e.g.,      Dhruv B Pai, ‘Mapping the Genealogy of Medical Device']","Dataset poisoning is a major concern in AI-medical devices because it can significantly undermine the accuracy and reliability of the machine-learning models that these devices rely on for decision-making. When datasets are poisoned, the data can be manipulated, either by changing existing values, inserting random numbers, or deleting parts of the dataset. This manipulation can lead to incorrect outcomes from the AI, potentially decreasing the accuracy of the models by as much as 24%. 

In the context of medical devices, such inaccuracies can pose serious risks to patient safety. For instance, an AI system that misinterprets data due to poisoned datasets could make flawed medical decisions, which might lead to injury or even endanger a patient's health. Furthermore, the complexity of AI and machine learning means that these vulnerabilities are not just theoretical; they could manifest in real-world scenarios where the consequences are dire. Overall, the reliance of AI on high-quality, trustworthy data makes dataset poisoning one of the most significant vulnerabilities for ML-based systems in healthcare.",Cybersecurity of AI MD

Effective security risk assessments address the \nfact that cybersecurity-related failures can occur either intentionally or unintentionally. \nAccordingly, cybersecurity risks are difficult to predict, meaning that it is not possible to assess \nand quantify the likelihood of an incident occurring based on historical data or modeling (also \nknown as a “probabilistic manner”). This non-probabilistic approach is not the fundamental \napproach performed in safety risk management under ISO 14971 and further underscores why \nsafety and security risk management are distinct but connected processes. Instead, security risk \nassessment processes focus on exploitability, or the ability to exploit vulnerabilities present \nwithin a device and/or system. FDA recommends that manufacturers assess identified risks \naccording to the level of risk posed from the device and the system in which it operates. \nAdditional discussion on exploitability assessments for the security risk assessment can be found \nin the FDA’s Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance. \n \nThe premarket assessment of exploitability of a cybersecurity risk may be different from the \nexploitability assessment of a vulnerability discovered postmarket. For example, some of the \nexploitability factors discussed in the Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance (e.g., Exploit Code \nMaturity, Remediation Level, Report Confidence)39 may not be applicable to unreleased \nsoftware. In these instances, a premarket exploitability assessment could either assume a worst-\ncase assessment and implement appropriate controls, or provide a justification for a reasonable \nexploitability assessment of the risk throughout the TPLC and how the risk is controlled.  \n \nAcceptance criteria for cybersecurity risks should carefully consider the TPLC of the medical \ndevice system, as it might be more difficult to mitigate cybersecurity issues once the device is \nmarketed. As discussed above in Sections IV.B. and V.A., known vulnerabilities should be \nassessed as reasonably foreseeable risks. The cybersecurity risk assessment for vulnerabilities \nidentified during cybersecurity testing should also consider the TPLC of the device as the \nexploitability of the vulnerability is likely to increase over the device lifecycle. If a vulnerability \nscan or penetration tester, for example, was able to exploit a vulnerability, the ability of a threat \nactor to exploit that vulnerability is likely to increase over the device lifecycle. Furthermore, \nvulnerabilities identified in Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Known \nExploited Vulnerabilities Catalog40 should be designed out of the device, as they are already \nbeing exploited and expose the medical device system and users to the risk. \n \nFDA recommends that the cybersecurity risk assessment provided in premarket submissions \nshould capture the risks and controls identified from the threat model. The methods used for \nscoring the risk pre- and post-mitigation and the associated acceptance criteria as well as the \nmethod for transferring security risks into the safety risk assessment process should also be \nprovided as part of the premarket submission.  \n \n39 These factors of exploitability are from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 3.0 as \nidentified in the Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance (available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-\ninformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/postmarket-management-cybersecurity-medical-devices).

 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \nManufacturers should have a process for assessing the exploitability of a cybersecurity \nvulnerability. In many cases, estimating the probability of a cybersecurity exploit is very difficult \ndue to factors such as; complexity of exploitation, availability of exploits, and exploit toolkits.  In \nthe absence of data on the probability of the occurrence of harm, conventional medical device risk \nmanagement approaches suggest using a “reasonable worst-case estimate” or setting the default \nvalue of the probability to one. While these approaches are acceptable, FDA suggests that \nmanufacturers instead consider using a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tool or similar \nscoring system for rating vulnerabilities and determining the need for and urgency of the \nresponse. \nOne such tool, the “Common Vulnerability Scoring System,” Version 3.0, for example, provides \nnumerical ratings corresponding to high, medium and low by incorporating a number of factors in \nassessing exploitability including:\n \n16 \n20 \n· Attack Vector (physical, local, adjacent, network) \n· Attack Complexity (high, low) \n· Privileges Required (none, low, high) \n· User Interaction (none, required) \n· Scope (changed, unchanged) \n· Confidentiality Impact (high, low, none) \n· Integrity Impact (none, low, high) \n· Availability Impact (high, low, none) \n· Exploit Code Maturity (high, functional, proof-of-concept, unproven) \n· Remediation Level (unavailable, work-around, temporary fix, official fix, not defined) \n· Report Confidence (confirmed, reasonable, unknown, not defined) \nIn using any vulnerability scoring system (or tool), weighting of the individual factors that \ncontribute to the composite score should be carefully considered. \nOther resources that may aid in the triage of vulnerabilities are:  AAMI TIR57:  Principles for \nmedical device security – Risk management21, IEC 80001: Application of risk management for IT \nNetworks incorporating medical devices22, the National Vulnerability Database23 (NVD), the \nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures24 (CVE), Common Weakness Enumeration25 (CWE), \nCommon Weakness Scoring System26 (CWSS), Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and \n                                                 \n20 For a full description of each factor, see “Common Vulnerability Scoring System,” Version 3.0: Specification \nDocument (https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document). \n21 AAMI TIR57: Principles for medical device security—Risk management - See more at: \nhttp://www.aami.org/productspublications/ProductDetail.aspx?ItemNumber=3729#sthash.CqfSLyu9.dpuf\n22 IEC/TR 80001-2-1:2012 Application of risk management for IT-networks incorporating medical devices \n23 National Vulnerability Database (NVD; https://nvd.nist.gov/).\n24 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE; https://cve.mitre.org/). \n25 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE; http://cwe.mitre.org/index.html).\n26 Common Weakness Scoring System (CWSS; http://cwe.mitre.org/cwss/cwss_v1.0.1.html).'

 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \nManufacturers should define, as part of the comprehensive cybersecurity risk management, the \nsafety and essential performance of their device, the resulting severity of patient harm if \ncompromised, and the risk acceptance criteria. These steps allow manufacturers to triage \nvulnerabilities for remediation (see Section VI for additional information on risk assessments).   \nThreat modeling is important in understanding and assessing the exploitability of a device \nvulnerability and potential for patient harm. Threat modeling can also be used in determining \nwhether a proposed or implemented remediation can provide assurance that the risk of patient \nharm due to a cybersecurity vulnerability is reasonably controlled. Importantly, acceptable \nmitigations will vary depending upon the severity of patient harm that may result from \nexploitation of a vulnerability affecting the device. For example, a cybersecurity vulnerability \naffecting the temperature reading of a thermometer may have different risks than a cybersecurity \nvulnerability affecting the dosage of an insulin infusion pump because of the severity of patient \nharm.   \nVI. Medical\xa0Device\xa0Cybersecurity\xa0Risk\xa0Management\xa0\nAs part of their risk management process consistent with 21 CFR part 820, a manufacturer should \nestablish, document, and maintain throughout the medical device lifecycle an ongoing process for \nidentifying hazards associated with the cybersecurity of a medical device, estimating and \nevaluating the associated risks, controlling these risks, and monitoring the effectiveness of the \ncontrols. This process should include risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, and incorporation \nof production and post-production information. Elements identified in the Appendix of this \nguidance should be included as part of the manufacturer’s cybersecurity risk management \nprogram to support an effective risk management process. Manufacturers should have a defined \nprocess to systematically conduct a risk evaluation and determine whether a cybersecurity \nvulnerability affecting a medical device presents an acceptable or unacceptable risk. It is not \npossible to describe all hazards, associated risks, and/or controls associated with medical device \ncybersecurity vulnerabilities in this guidance. It is also not possible to describe all scenarios \nwhere risk is controlled or uncontrolled. Rather, FDA recommends that manufacturers define and \ndocument their process for objectively assessing the cybersecurity risk for their device(s).   \nAs outlined below, it is recommended that such a process focus on assessing the risk of patient \nharm by considering:  \n1) The exploitability of the cybersecurity vulnerability, and  \n2) The severity of patient harm if the vulnerability were to be exploited.   \nSuch analysis should also incorporate consideration of compensating controls and risk \nmitigations. \nA. \nAssessing Exploitability of the Cybersecurity \nVulnerability \n \n15']","The FDA’s security-risk assessment focuses on exploitability rather than historical probability because cybersecurity-related failures can occur either intentionally or unintentionally and are inherently difficult to predict. Unlike safety risk management, which may rely on historical data or modeling to assess and quantify the likelihood of incidents in a probabilistic manner, cybersecurity risks are more about the ability to exploit existing vulnerabilities within a device or system. 

This non-probabilistic approach emphasizes understanding the exploitability of identified risks rather than trying to estimate the likelihood of occurrence based on past incidents. The FDA recommends that manufacturers assess identified risks according to the level of risk posed by the device and the system in which it operates, considering that the exploitability of a vulnerability may increase over the device lifecycle. Therefore, focusing on exploitability allows for a more effective risk management process that accounts for the unique nature of cybersecurity threats.",FDA Premarket

For more information on \nSPDFs, see earlier in Section V. In addition, FDA does not recommend that manufacturers \ndiscontinue existing, effective processes. \nA. \nSecurity Risk Management \nTo fully account for cybersecurity risks in medical device systems, the safety and security risks \nof each device should be assessed within the context of the larger system in which the device \noperates. In the context of cybersecurity, security risk management processes are critical \nbecause, given the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats and risks, no device is, or can be, \ncompletely secure. Security risk management should be an integrated part of a manufacturer’s \nentire quality system, addressed throughout the TPLC.32 The quality system processes entail the \ntechnical, personnel, and management practices, among others, that manufacturers use to manage \npotential risks to their devices and ensure that their devices are, and once on the market, remain, \nsafe and effective, which includes security.  \n \nPerforming security risk management is distinct from performing safety risk management as \ndescribed in ISO 14971. The distinction in the performance of these processes is due to the fact \nthat in the security context versus the safety context, the scope of possible harm and the risk \nassessment factors may be different. Also, while safety risk management focuses on physical \ninjury, damage to property or the environment, or delay and/or denial of care due to device or \nsystem unavailability, security risk management may include risks that can result in indirect or \ndirect patient harm. Additionally, risks that are outside of FDA’s assessment of safety and \neffectiveness, such as those related to business or reputational risks, may also exist.  \n \nThe scope and objective of a security risk management process, in conjunction with other SPDF \nprocesses (e.g., security testing), is to expose how threats, through vulnerabilities, can manifest \npatient harm and other potential risks. These processes should also ensure that risk control \nmeasures for one type of risk assessment do not inadvertently introduce new risks in the other. \nFor example, AAMI TIR57 details how the security and safety risk management processes \nshould interface to ensure all risks are adequately assessed.33 FDA recommends that security risk \nmanagement processes, as detailed in the QS regulation,34 be established or incorporated into \nthose that already exist, and should address the manufacturer’s design, manufacturing, and \ndistribution processes, as well as updates across the TPLC. The processes in the QS regulation \nwhich may be relevant in this context include, but are not limited to design controls (21 CFR \n820.30), validation of production processes (21 CFR 820.70), and corrective and preventive \nactions (21 CFR 820.100) to ensure both safety and security risks are adequately addressed. For \ncompleteness in performing risk analyses under 21 CFR 820.30(g), FDA recommends that \ndevice manufacturers conduct both a safety risk assessment and a separate, accompanying \nsecurity risk assessment to ensure a more comprehensive identification and management of \npatient safety risks.  \n \n32 The TPLC processes include design and development, manufacturing, postmarket monitoring, delivering device \nsoftware and firmware updates, and servicing, among others.  \n33 AAMI TIR57 Principles for medical device security—Risk management describes the security risk management \nprocess and how the security risk management process should have links into the safety risk management process \nand vice versa.  \n34 21 CFR 820.'
 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 12 \n \nA device should be designed to eliminate or mitigate known vulnerabilities. For marketed \ndevices, if comprehensive design mitigations are not possible, compensating controls should be \nconsidered. For all devices, when any known vulnerabilities are only partially mitigated or \nunmitigated by the device design, they should be assessed as reasonably foreseeable risks in the \nrisk assessment and be assessed for additional control measures or risk transfer35 to the \nuser/operator, or, if necessary, the patient. Risk transfer, if appropriate, should only occur when \nall relevant risk information is known, assessed, and appropriately communicated to users and \nincludes risks inherited from the supply chain as well as how risk transfer will be handled when \nthe device or manufacturer-controlled assets of the medical device system reaches end of support \nand end of life and whether or how the user is able to take on that role (e.g., if the user may be a \npatient).  \n \nTo document the security risk management activities for a medical device system, FDA \nrecommends that manufacturers generate a security risk management plan and report such as that \ndescribed in AAMI TIR57.36 Manufacturers should include their security risk management \nreports—including the outputs of their security risk management processes—in their premarket \nsubmissions to help demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device. A security risk \nmanagement report, such as that described in that in AAMI TIR57, should be sufficient to \nsupport the security risk management process aspect of demonstrating a reasonable assurance of \nsafety and effectiveness. Such report should include the documentation elements for the system \nthreat modeling, cybersecurity risk assessment, Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), component \nsupport information, vulnerability assessments, and unresolved anomaly assessment(s) described \nin the sections below.37 In the subsections below, we discuss FDA’s recommendations regarding \nthe scope and/or content of specific security risk management documentation elements. \n  \nIn addition to containing the documentation elements listed above, the security risk management \nreport should:  \n \n• Summarize the risk evaluation methods and processes,  \n• Detail the residual risk conclusion from the security risk assessment,  \n• Detail the risk mitigation activities undertaken as part of a manufacturer’s risk \nmanagement processes, and  \n• Provide traceability between the threat model, cybersecurity risk assessment, SBOM, and \ntesting documentation as discussed later in this guidance as well as other relevant \ncybersecurity risk management documentation.  \n \n \n35 For the purposes of this guidance, we consider “risk transfer” to include actions taken to manage risk that shifts \nsome or all of the risk to another user, asset, system, network, or geographic area.

 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 10 \nFor cyber devices, some of the information recommended in this guidance may help \nmanufacturers meet their obligations for what is required to be in premarket submissions under \nsection 524B.  \nV. Using an SPDF to Manage Cybersecurity Risks \nThe documentation recommended in this guidance is based on FDA’s experience evaluating the \nsafety and effectiveness of devices with cybersecurity vulnerabilities. However, sponsors may \nuse alternative approaches and provide different documentation so long as their approach and \ndocumentation satisfy premarket submission requirements in applicable statutory provisions and \nregulations. The increasingly interconnected nature of medical devices has demonstrated the \nimportance of addressing cybersecurity risks associated with device connectivity in device \ndesign because of the effects on safety and effectiveness.28 Cybersecurity risks to the medical \ndevice or to the larger medical device system can be reasonably controlled through using an \nSPDF. \n \nThe primary goal of using an SPDF is to manufacture and maintain safe and effective devices. \nFrom a security standpoint, these are also trustworthy and resilient devices. These devices can \nthen be managed (e.g., installed, configured, updated, review of device logs) through the device \ndesign and associated labeling by the device manufacturers and/or users (e.g., patients, \nhealthcare facilities). For healthcare facilities, these devices can also be managed within their \nown cybersecurity risk management frameworks, such as the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, generally \nreferred to as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework or NIST CSF.29  \n \nFDA recommends that manufacturers use device design processes such as those described in the \nQS regulation to support secure product development and maintenance. To preserve flexibility \nfor manufacturers, manufacturers may use other existing frameworks that satisfy the QS \nregulation and align with FDA’s recommendations for using an SPDF. Possible frameworks to \nconsider include, but are not limited to the medical device-specific framework that can be found \nin the Medical Device and Health IT Joint Security Plan (JSP) 30 and IEC 81001-5-1. \nFrameworks from other sectors may also comply with the QS regulations, like the framework \nprovided in ANSI/ISA 62443-4-1 Security for industrial automation and control systems Part 4-\n1: Product security development life-cycle requirements.31 \n \nThe following subsections provide recommendations for using SPDF processes that FDA \nbelieves provide important considerations for the development of devices that are safe and \neffective, how these processes can complement the QS regulation, and the documentation FDA \nrecommends manufacturers provide for review as part of premarket submissions. The \n \n28 Addressing cybersecurity risks is in addition to addressing other risks, including software, biocompatibility, \nsterilization, and electromagnetic compatibility, among others. \n29 For more information, please see the NIST Cybersecurity Framework available at \nhttps://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  \n30 Medical Device and Health IT Joint Security Plan (JSP) is available at https://healthsectorcouncil.org/the-joint-\nsecurity-plan/ \n31 ANSI/ISA-62443-4-1 Security for industrial automation and control systems Part 4-1: Product security \ndevelopment life-cycle requirements outlines a secure product development lifecycle similar to that of the JSP.'
 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 19 \nFor example, a clinical user may inadvertently reveal the presence of a previously unknown \nsoftware anomaly during normal use, where the impact of the anomaly might occur sporadically \nand be assessed to be acceptable from a software risk perspective. Conversely, a threat might \nseek out these types of anomalies, and identify means to exploit them in order to manifest the \nanomaly’s impact continuously, which could significantly impact the acceptability of the risk \nwhen compared to an anomaly assessment that didn’t include security considerations. \n \nThe criteria and rationales for addressing the resulting anomalies with security impacts should be \nprovided as part of documentation in the premarket submission. \n \n6. \nTPLC Security Risk Management \nCybersecurity risks may continue to be identified throughout the device’s TPLC. Manufacturers \nshould ensure they have appropriate resources to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity \nvulnerabilities as they are identified throughout the supported device lifecycle.  \n \nAs part of using an SPDF, manufacturers should update their security risk management \ndocumentation as new information becomes available, such as when new threats, vulnerabilities, \nassets, or adverse impacts are discovered during development and after the device is released. \nWhen maintained throughout the device lifecycle, this documentation (e.g., threat modeling) can \nbe used to quickly identify vulnerability impacts once a device is released and, when appropriate, \nto support timely corrective and preventive action activities described in 21 CFR 820.100.  \n \nOver the service life of a device, FDA recommends that the risk management documentation \naccount for any differences in the risk management for fielded devices (e.g., marketed devices or \ndevices no longer marketed but still in use). For example, if an update is not applied \nautomatically for all fielded devices, then there will likely be different risk profiles for differing \nsoftware configurations of the device. FDA recommends that vulnerabilities be assessed for any \ndiffering impacts for all fielded versions to ensure patient risks are being accurately assessed. \nAdditional information as to whether a new premarket submission (e.g., PMA, PMA supplement, \nor 510(k)) or 21 CFR Part 806 reporting is needed based on postmarket vulnerabilities and \ngeneral postmarket cybersecurity risk management is discussed in the Postmarket Cybersecurity \nGuidance.  \n \nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of a manufacturer’s processes, FDA recommends that a \nmanufacturer track and record the measures and metrics below,53 and provide them in premarket \nsubmissions and PMA annual reports (21 CFR 814.84), when available.54 Selecting appropriate \nmeasures and metrics for the processes that define an SPDF is important to ensure that device \ndesign appropriately addresses cybersecurity in compliance with the QS regulation. At a \nminimum, FDA recommends tracking the following measures and metrics, or those that provide \nequivalent information: \n \n \n53 The measures and metrics provided are examples; alternative or additional measures and metrics may also be \nconsidered and reported.  \n54 If a manufacturer has not marketed prior versions or the premarket submission does not pertain to a marketed \nproduct (e.g., PMA supplement), FDA acknowledges that these measures and metrics might not be available, but \nrecommends that manufacturers include these as part of their risk management plan and SPDF processes.']","The FDA recommends that manufacturers generate a security risk management plan and report, such as that described in AAMI TIR57, to document security risk management activities for a medical device system.",FDA Premarket

The distinction in the performance of these processes is due to the fact \nthat in the security context versus the safety context, the scope of possible harm and the risk \nassessment factors may be different. Also, while safety risk management focuses on physical \ninjury, damage to property or the environment, or delay and/or denial of care due to device or \nsystem unavailability, security risk management may include risks that can result in indirect or \ndirect patient harm. Additionally, risks that are outside of FDA’s assessment of safety and \neffectiveness, such as those related to business or reputational risks, may also exist.  \n \nThe scope and objective of a security risk management process, in conjunction with other SPDF \nprocesses (e.g., security testing), is to expose how threats, through vulnerabilities, can manifest \npatient harm and other potential risks. These processes should also ensure that risk control \nmeasures for one type of risk assessment do not inadvertently introduce new risks in the other. \nFor example, AAMI TIR57 details how the security and safety risk management processes \nshould interface to ensure all risks are adequately assessed.33 FDA recommends that security risk \nmanagement processes, as detailed in the QS regulation,34 be established or incorporated into \nthose that already exist, and should address the manufacturer’s design, manufacturing, and \ndistribution processes, as well as updates across the TPLC. The processes in the QS regulation \nwhich may be relevant in this context include, but are not limited to design controls (21 CFR \n820.30), validation of production processes (21 CFR 820.70), and corrective and preventive \nactions (21 CFR 820.100) to ensure both safety and security risks are adequately addressed. For \ncompleteness in performing risk analyses under 21 CFR 820.30(g), FDA recommends that \ndevice manufacturers conduct both a safety risk assessment and a separate, accompanying \nsecurity risk assessment to ensure a more comprehensive identification and management of \npatient safety risks.  \n \n32 The TPLC processes include design and development, manufacturing, postmarket monitoring, delivering device \nsoftware and firmware updates, and servicing, among others.  \n33 AAMI TIR57 Principles for medical device security—Risk management describes the security risk management \nprocess and how the security risk management process should have links into the safety risk management process \nand vice versa.  \n34 21 CFR 820.'
 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 12 \n \nA device should be designed to eliminate or mitigate known vulnerabilities. For marketed \ndevices, if comprehensive design mitigations are not possible, compensating controls should be \nconsidered. For all devices, when any known vulnerabilities are only partially mitigated or \nunmitigated by the device design, they should be assessed as reasonably foreseeable risks in the \nrisk assessment and be assessed for additional control measures or risk transfer35 to the \nuser/operator, or, if necessary, the patient. Risk transfer, if appropriate, should only occur when \nall relevant risk information is known, assessed, and appropriately communicated to users and \nincludes risks inherited from the supply chain as well as how risk transfer will be handled when \nthe device or manufacturer-controlled assets of the medical device system reaches end of support \nand end of life and whether or how the user is able to take on that role (e.g., if the user may be a \npatient).  \n \nTo document the security risk management activities for a medical device system, FDA \nrecommends that manufacturers generate a security risk management plan and report such as that \ndescribed in AAMI TIR57.36 Manufacturers should include their security risk management \nreports—including the outputs of their security risk management processes—in their premarket \nsubmissions to help demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device. A security risk \nmanagement report, such as that described in that in AAMI TIR57, should be sufficient to \nsupport the security risk management process aspect of demonstrating a reasonable assurance of \nsafety and effectiveness. Such report should include the documentation elements for the system \nthreat modeling, cybersecurity risk assessment, Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), component \nsupport information, vulnerability assessments, and unresolved anomaly assessment(s) described \nin the sections below.37 In the subsections below, we discuss FDA’s recommendations regarding \nthe scope and/or content of specific security risk management documentation elements. \n  \nIn addition to containing the documentation elements listed above, the security risk management \nreport should:  \n \n• Summarize the risk evaluation methods and processes,  \n• Detail the residual risk conclusion from the security risk assessment,  \n• Detail the risk mitigation activities undertaken as part of a manufacturer’s risk \nmanagement processes, and  \n• Provide traceability between the threat model, cybersecurity risk assessment, SBOM, and \ntesting documentation as discussed later in this guidance as well as other relevant \ncybersecurity risk management documentation.  \n \n \n35 For the purposes of this guidance, we consider “risk transfer” to include actions taken to manage risk that shifts \nsome or all of the risk to another user, asset, system, network, or geographic area. This definition is adapted from the \nDHS Risk Lexicon available at https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/dhs-risk-lexicon \n36 Details on the content for security risk management plans and reports beyond those specifically identified can be \nfound in AAMI TIR57 Principles for medical device security—Risk management. \n37 While security architecture is likely captured as a component of the security risk management process, it is \ndiscussed separately for the purposes of this guidance due to the level of detail recommended to be provided by \nmanufacturers in order to facilitate FDA review of the safety and effectiveness of the device.'
 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 14 \n2. \nCybersecurity Risk Assessment \nAs a part of security risk management, security risks and controls should be assessed for residual \nrisks as part of a cybersecurity risk assessment. Effective security risk assessments address the \nfact that cybersecurity-related failures can occur either intentionally or unintentionally. \nAccordingly, cybersecurity risks are difficult to predict, meaning that it is not possible to assess \nand quantify the likelihood of an incident occurring based on historical data or modeling (also \nknown as a “probabilistic manner”). This non-probabilistic approach is not the fundamental \napproach performed in safety risk management under ISO 14971 and further underscores why \nsafety and security risk management are distinct but connected processes. Instead, security risk \nassessment processes focus on exploitability, or the ability to exploit vulnerabilities present \nwithin a device and/or system. FDA recommends that manufacturers assess identified risks \naccording to the level of risk posed from the device and the system in which it operates. \nAdditional discussion on exploitability assessments for the security risk assessment can be found \nin the FDA’s Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance. \n \nThe premarket assessment of exploitability of a cybersecurity risk may be different from the \nexploitability assessment of a vulnerability discovered postmarket. For example, some of the \nexploitability factors discussed in the Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance (e.g., Exploit Code \nMaturity, Remediation Level, Report Confidence)39 may not be applicable to unreleased \nsoftware. In these instances, a premarket exploitability assessment could either assume a worst-\ncase assessment and implement appropriate controls, or provide a justification for a reasonable \nexploitability assessment of the risk throughout the TPLC and how the risk is controlled.  \n \nAcceptance criteria for cybersecurity risks should carefully consider the TPLC of the medical \ndevice system, as it might be more difficult to mitigate cybersecurity issues once the device is \nmarketed. As discussed above in Sections IV.B. and V.A., known vulnerabilities should be \nassessed as reasonably foreseeable risks. The cybersecurity risk assessment for vulnerabilities \nidentified during cybersecurity testing should also consider the TPLC of the device as the \nexploitability of the vulnerability is likely to increase over the device lifecycle. If a vulnerability \nscan or penetration tester, for example, was able to exploit a vulnerability, the ability of a threat \nactor to exploit that vulnerability is likely to increase over the device lifecycle. Furthermore, \nvulnerabilities identified in Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Known \nExploited Vulnerabilities Catalog40 should be designed out of the device, as they are already \nbeing exploited and expose the medical device system and users to the risk. \n \nFDA recommends that the cybersecurity risk assessment provided in premarket submissions \nshould capture the risks and controls identified from the threat model. The methods used for \nscoring the risk pre- and post-mitigation and the associated acceptance criteria as well as the \nmethod for transferring security risks into the safety risk assessment process should also be \nprovided as part of the premarket submission.  \n \n39 These factors of exploitability are from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 3.0 as \nidentified in the Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance (available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-\ninformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/postmarket-management-cybersecurity-medical-devices).

 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 19 \nFor example, a clinical user may inadvertently reveal the presence of a previously unknown \nsoftware anomaly during normal use, where the impact of the anomaly might occur sporadically \nand be assessed to be acceptable from a software risk perspective. Conversely, a threat might \nseek out these types of anomalies, and identify means to exploit them in order to manifest the \nanomaly’s impact continuously, which could significantly impact the acceptability of the risk \nwhen compared to an anomaly assessment that didn’t include security considerations. \n \nThe criteria and rationales for addressing the resulting anomalies with security impacts should be \nprovided as part of documentation in the premarket submission. \n \n6. \nTPLC Security Risk Management \nCybersecurity risks may continue to be identified throughout the device’s TPLC. Manufacturers \nshould ensure they have appropriate resources to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity \nvulnerabilities as they are identified throughout the supported device lifecycle.  \n \nAs part of using an SPDF, manufacturers should update their security risk management \ndocumentation as new information becomes available, such as when new threats, vulnerabilities, \nassets, or adverse impacts are discovered during development and after the device is released. \nWhen maintained throughout the device lifecycle, this documentation (e.g., threat modeling) can \nbe used to quickly identify vulnerability impacts once a device is released and, when appropriate, \nto support timely corrective and preventive action activities described in 21 CFR 820.100.  \n \nOver the service life of a device, FDA recommends that the risk management documentation \naccount for any differences in the risk management for fielded devices (e.g., marketed devices or \ndevices no longer marketed but still in use). For example, if an update is not applied \nautomatically for all fielded devices, then there will likely be different risk profiles for differing \nsoftware configurations of the device. FDA recommends that vulnerabilities be assessed for any \ndiffering impacts for all fielded versions to ensure patient risks are being accurately assessed. \nAdditional information as to whether a new premarket submission (e.g., PMA, PMA supplement, \nor 510(k)) or 21 CFR Part 806 reporting is needed based on postmarket vulnerabilities and \ngeneral postmarket cybersecurity risk management is discussed in the Postmarket Cybersecurity \nGuidance.  \n \nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of a manufacturer’s processes, FDA recommends that a \nmanufacturer track and record the measures and metrics below,53 and provide them in premarket \nsubmissions and PMA annual reports (21 CFR 814.84), when available.54 Selecting appropriate \nmeasures and metrics for the processes that define an SPDF is important to ensure that device \ndesign appropriately addresses cybersecurity in compliance with the QS regulation. At a \nminimum, FDA recommends tracking the following measures and metrics, or those that provide \nequivalent information: \n \n \n53 The measures and metrics provided are examples; alternative or additional measures and metrics may also be \nconsidered and reported.  \n54 If a manufacturer has not marketed prior versions or the premarket submission does not pertain to a marketed \nproduct (e.g., PMA supplement), FDA acknowledges that these measures and metrics might not be available, but \nrecommends that manufacturers include these as part of their risk management plan and SPDF processes.']","The FDA expects the security risk management report to include the following four elements:

General\xa0Principles\xa0\nFDA recognizes that medical device cybersecurity is a shared responsibility among stakeholders \nincluding health care facilities, patients, providers, and manufacturers of medical devices.

Remediation actions may include \ncomplete solutions to remove a cybersecurity vulnerability from a medical device or \ncompensating controls that adequately mitigate the risk (e.g., notification to customers and the \nuser community identifying a control the user can implement). An example of remediation is a \nnotification to the customers and the user community that discloses the vulnerability, the impact \nto the device, the potential for patient harm, and provides a strategy to reduce the risk of patient \nharm to an acceptable and controlled level.

In \nthe absence of data on the probability of the occurrence of harm, conventional medical device risk \nmanagement approaches suggest using a “reasonable worst-case estimate” or setting the default \nvalue of the probability to one. While these approaches are acceptable, FDA suggests that \nmanufacturers instead consider using a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tool or similar \nscoring system for rating vulnerabilities and determining the need for and urgency of the \nresponse. \nOne such tool, the “Common Vulnerability Scoring System,” Version 3.0, for example, provides \nnumerical ratings corresponding to high, medium and low by incorporating a number of factors in \nassessing exploitability including:\n \n16 \n20 \n· Attack Vector (physical, local, adjacent, network) \n· Attack Complexity (high, low) \n· Privileges Required (none, low, high) \n· User Interaction (none, required) \n· Scope (changed, unchanged) \n· Confidentiality Impact (high, low, none) \n· Integrity Impact (none, low, high) \n· Availability Impact (high, low, none) \n· Exploit Code Maturity (high, functional, proof-of-concept, unproven) \n· Remediation Level (unavailable, work-around, temporary fix, official fix, not defined) \n· Report Confidence (confirmed, reasonable, unknown, not defined) \nIn using any vulnerability scoring system (or tool), weighting of the individual factors that \ncontribute to the composite score should be carefully considered. \nOther resources that may aid in the triage of vulnerabilities are:  AAMI TIR57:  Principles for \nmedical device security – Risk management21, IEC 80001: Application of risk management for IT \nNetworks incorporating medical devices22, the National Vulnerability Database23 (NVD), the \nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures24 (CVE), Common Weakness Enumeration25 (CWE), \nCommon Weakness Scoring System26 (CWSS), Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and \n                                                 \n20 For a full description of each factor, see “Common Vulnerability Scoring System,” Version 3.0: Specification \nDocument (https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document). \n21 AAMI TIR57: Principles for medical device security—Risk management - See more at: \nhttp://www.aami.org/productspublications/ProductDetail.aspx?ItemNumber=3729#sthash.CqfSLyu9.dpuf\n22 IEC/TR 80001-2-1:2012 Application of risk management for IT-networks incorporating medical devices \n23 National Vulnerability Database (NVD; https://nvd.nist.gov/).\n24 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE; https://cve.mitre.org/). \n25 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE; http://cwe.mitre.org/index.html).\n26 Common Weakness Scoring System (CWSS; http://cwe.mitre.org/cwss/cwss_v1.0.1.html).'

One method of \nassessing the acceptability of risk involves using a matrix with combinations of “exploitability” \nand “severity of patient harm” to determine whether the risk of patient harm is controlled or \nuncontrolled. A manufacturer can then conduct assessments of the exploitability and severity of \npatient harm and then use such a matrix to assess the risk of patient harm for the identified \ncybersecurity vulnerabilities. \nFor risks that remain uncontrolled, additional remediation should be implemented. \nThe following figure is an example matrix that shows a possible approach to evaluate the \nrelationship between exploitability and patient harm. It can be used to assess the risk of patient \nharm from a cybersecurity vulnerability as controlled or uncontrolled. While in some cases the \nevaluation will yield a definite determination that the situation is controlled or uncontrolled, it is \npossible that in other situations this determination may not be as distinct. Nevertheless, in all \ncases, FDA recommends that manufacturers make a binary determination that a vulnerability is \neither controlled or uncontrolled using an established process that is tailored to the product, its \nsafety and essential performance, and the situation. Risk mitigations, including compensating \ncontrols, should be implemented when necessary to bring the residual risk to an acceptable level. \n                                                 \n27 Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC; http://capec.mitre.org/). \n28 Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE; https://nvd.nist.gov/cce/index.cfm).\n29 Common Platform Enumeration (CPE; https://nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm).'

See Section VI for additional guidance \non vulnerability risk assessment. \nii. Risk Analysis and Threat Modeling \nThe FDA recommends that manufacturers conduct cybersecurity risk analyses that include \nthreat modeling for each of their devices and to update those analyses over time.  Risk \nanalyses and threat modeling should aim to triage vulnerabilities for timely remediation.  \nThreat modeling is a procedure for optimizing Network/Application/Internet Security by \nidentifying objectives and vulnerabilities, and then defining countermeasures to prevent, \nor mitigate the effects of, threats to the system.  Threat modeling provides traditional risk \nmanagement and failure mode analysis paradigms, and a framework to assess threats from \nactive adversaries/malicious use. For each vulnerability, a summary report should be \nproduced that concisely summarizes the risk analysis and threat modeling information. \nDue to the cyclical nature of the analyses, the information should be traceable to related \ndocumentation. \n \n                                                 \n43 “Common Vulnerability Scoring System,” Version 3.0, Scoring Calculator \n(https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0).'
 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 14 \n2. \nCybersecurity Risk Assessment \nAs a part of security risk management, security risks and controls should be assessed for residual \nrisks as part of a cybersecurity risk assessment. Effective security risk assessments address the \nfact that cybersecurity-related failures can occur either intentionally or unintentionally. \nAccordingly, cybersecurity risks are difficult to predict, meaning that it is not possible to assess \nand quantify the likelihood of an incident occurring based on historical data or modeling (also \nknown as a “probabilistic manner”). This non-probabilistic approach is not the fundamental \napproach performed in safety risk management under ISO 14971 and further underscores why \nsafety and security risk management are distinct but connected processes. Instead, security risk \nassessment processes focus on exploitability, or the ability to exploit vulnerabilities present \nwithin a device and/or system. FDA recommends that manufacturers assess identified risks \naccording to the level of risk posed from the device and the system in which it operates. \nAdditional discussion on exploitability assessments for the security risk assessment can be found \nin the FDA’s Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance. \n \nThe premarket assessment of exploitability of a cybersecurity risk may be different from the \nexploitability assessment of a vulnerability discovered postmarket. For example, some of the \nexploitability factors discussed in the Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance (e.g., Exploit Code \nMaturity, Remediation Level, Report Confidence)39 may not be applicable to unreleased \nsoftware. In these instances, a premarket exploitability assessment could either assume a worst-\ncase assessment and implement appropriate controls, or provide a justification for a reasonable \nexploitability assessment of the risk throughout the TPLC and how the risk is controlled.  \n \nAcceptance criteria for cybersecurity risks should carefully consider the TPLC of the medical \ndevice system, as it might be more difficult to mitigate cybersecurity issues once the device is \nmarketed. As discussed above in Sections IV.B. and V.A., known vulnerabilities should be \nassessed as reasonably foreseeable risks. The cybersecurity risk assessment for vulnerabilities \nidentified during cybersecurity testing should also consider the TPLC of the device as the \nexploitability of the vulnerability is likely to increase over the device lifecycle. If a vulnerability \nscan or penetration tester, for example, was able to exploit a vulnerability, the ability of a threat \nactor to exploit that vulnerability is likely to increase over the device lifecycle. Furthermore, \nvulnerabilities identified in Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Known \nExploited Vulnerabilities Catalog40 should be designed out of the device, as they are already \nbeing exploited and expose the medical device system and users to the risk. \n \nFDA recommends that the cybersecurity risk assessment provided in premarket submissions \nshould capture the risks and controls identified from the threat model. The methods used for \nscoring the risk pre- and post-mitigation and the associated acceptance criteria as well as the \nmethod for transferring security risks into the safety risk assessment process should also be \nprovided as part of the premarket submission.  \n \n39 These factors of exploitability are from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 3.0 as \nidentified in the Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance (available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-\ninformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/postmarket-management-cybersecurity-medical-devices).

Manufacturers should consider the incorporation of design features \nthat establish or enhance the ability of the device to detect and produce forensically sound \npostmarket evidence capture in the event of an attack. This information may assist the \nmanufacturer in assessing and remediating identified risks. \nv. Impact Assessment on All Devices \nThe FDA recommends that manufacturers have a process to assess the impact of a \ncybersecurity signal horizontally (i.e., across all medical devices within the \nmanufacturer’s product portfolio and sometimes referred to as variant analyses) and \nvertically (i.e., determine if there is an impact on specific components within the device). \nA signal may identify a vulnerability in one device, and that same vulnerability may \nimpact other devices including those in development, or those not yet cleared, approved or \nmarketed. Therefore, it will be advantageous to manufacturers to conduct analyses for \ncybersecurity signals such that expended detection resources have the widest impact.   \nC. \nProtect/Respond/Recover \ni. Compensating Controls Assessment (Detect/Respond) \n· The FDA recommends that manufacturers implement device-based features, i.e. device \ndesign controls46, as a primary mechanism to mitigate the risk of patient harm.  \nManufacturers should assess and provide users with compensating controls such that the \nrisk of patient harm is further mitigated.

These risks may include those introduced by device reliance on hospital \nnetworks, cloud infrastructure, or “other functions” (as defined in FDA’s guidance Multiple \nFunction Device Products: Policy and Considerations), for example.

In addition, FDA does not recommend that manufacturers \ndiscontinue existing, effective processes. \nA. \nSecurity Risk Management \nTo fully account for cybersecurity risks in medical device systems, the safety and security risks \nof each device should be assessed within the context of the larger system in which the device \noperates. In the context of cybersecurity, security risk management processes are critical \nbecause, given the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats and risks, no device is, or can be, \ncompletely secure. Security risk management should be an integrated part of a manufacturer’s \nentire quality system, addressed throughout the TPLC.32 The quality system processes entail the \ntechnical, personnel, and management practices, among others, that manufacturers use to manage \npotential risks to their devices and ensure that their devices are, and once on the market, remain, \nsafe and effective, which includes security.  \n \nPerforming security risk management is distinct from performing safety risk management as \ndescribed in ISO 14971. The distinction in the performance of these processes is due to the fact \nthat in the security context versus the safety context, the scope of possible harm and the risk \nassessment factors may be different. Also, while safety risk management focuses on physical \ninjury, damage to property or the environment, or delay and/or denial of care due to device or \nsystem unavailability, security risk management may include risks that can result in indirect or \ndirect patient harm. Additionally, risks that are outside of FDA’s assessment of safety and \neffectiveness, such as those related to business or reputational risks, may also exist.  \n \nThe scope and objective of a security risk management process, in conjunction with other SPDF \nprocesses (e.g., security testing), is to expose how threats, through vulnerabilities, can manifest \npatient harm and other potential risks. These processes should also ensure that risk control \nmeasures for one type of risk assessment do not inadvertently introduce new risks in the other. \nFor example, AAMI TIR57 details how the security and safety risk management processes \nshould interface to ensure all risks are adequately assessed.33 FDA recommends that security risk \nmanagement processes, as detailed in the QS regulation,34 be established or incorporated into \nthose that already exist, and should address the manufacturer’s design, manufacturing, and \ndistribution processes, as well as updates across the TPLC. The processes in the QS regulation \nwhich may be relevant in this context include, but are not limited to design controls (21 CFR \n820.30), validation of production processes (21 CFR 820.70), and corrective and preventive \nactions (21 CFR 820.100) to ensure both safety and security risks are adequately addressed. For \ncompleteness in performing risk analyses under 21 CFR 820.30(g), FDA recommends that \ndevice manufacturers conduct both a safety risk assessment and a separate, accompanying \nsecurity risk assessment to ensure a more comprehensive identification and management of \npatient safety risks.  \n \n32 The TPLC processes include design and development, manufacturing, postmarket monitoring, delivering device \nsoftware and firmware updates, and servicing, among others.  \n33 AAMI TIR57 Principles for medical device security—Risk management describes the security risk management \nprocess and how the security risk management process should have links into the safety risk management process \nand vice versa.  \n34 21 CFR 820.'

1. **Scope of Possible Harm**: In safety risk management, which is described in ISO 14971, the focus is on physical injury, property damage, or environmental harm, as well as delay or denial of care due to device or system unavailability. In contrast, security risk management encompasses risks that can lead to both direct and indirect patient harm, as well as risks that may fall outside FDA's assessment of safety and effectiveness, such as business or reputational risks.

2. **Risk Assessment Factors**: The factors considered in assessing risks may differ between the two types of management. Security risk assessments specifically focus on exploitability—the likelihood that vulnerabilities can be exploited—rather than the historical data or probabilistic assessments that are more typical in safety risk management.

3. **Nature of Incidents**: Cybersecurity-related failures can occur both intentionally (e.g., malicious attacks) and unintentionally (e.g., software bugs), making them inherently difficult to predict. This contrasts with safety risks, which are generally more predictable based on historical data.

4. **Integration into Quality System**: Security risk management should be integrated into a manufacturer’s entire quality system and addressed throughout the Total Product Life Cycle (TPLC), while safety risk management is typically managed separately.

Overall, while both security and safety risk management processes aim to protect patients and ensure device effectiveness, they involve different considerations, methodologies, and areas of focus.",FDA Premarket

In addition, FDA does not recommend that manufacturers \ndiscontinue existing, effective processes. \nA. \nSecurity Risk Management \nTo fully account for cybersecurity risks in medical device systems, the safety and security risks \nof each device should be assessed within the context of the larger system in which the device \noperates. In the context of cybersecurity, security risk management processes are critical \nbecause, given the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats and risks, no device is, or can be, \ncompletely secure. Security risk management should be an integrated part of a manufacturer’s \nentire quality system, addressed throughout the TPLC.32 The quality system processes entail the \ntechnical, personnel, and management practices, among others, that manufacturers use to manage \npotential risks to their devices and ensure that their devices are, and once on the market, remain, \nsafe and effective, which includes security.  \n \nPerforming security risk management is distinct from performing safety risk management as \ndescribed in ISO 14971. The distinction in the performance of these processes is due to the fact \nthat in the security context versus the safety context, the scope of possible harm and the risk \nassessment factors may be different. Also, while safety risk management focuses on physical \ninjury, damage to property or the environment, or delay and/or denial of care due to device or \nsystem unavailability, security risk management may include risks that can result in indirect or \ndirect patient harm. Additionally, risks that are outside of FDA’s assessment of safety and \neffectiveness, such as those related to business or reputational risks, may also exist.  \n \nThe scope and objective of a security risk management process, in conjunction with other SPDF \nprocesses (e.g., security testing), is to expose how threats, through vulnerabilities, can manifest \npatient harm and other potential risks. These processes should also ensure that risk control \nmeasures for one type of risk assessment do not inadvertently introduce new risks in the other. \nFor example, AAMI TIR57 details how the security and safety risk management processes \nshould interface to ensure all risks are adequately assessed.33 FDA recommends that security risk \nmanagement processes, as detailed in the QS regulation,34 be established or incorporated into \nthose that already exist, and should address the manufacturer’s design, manufacturing, and \ndistribution processes, as well as updates across the TPLC. The processes in the QS regulation \nwhich may be relevant in this context include, but are not limited to design controls (21 CFR \n820.30), validation of production processes (21 CFR 820.70), and corrective and preventive \nactions (21 CFR 820.100) to ensure both safety and security risks are adequately addressed. For \ncompleteness in performing risk analyses under 21 CFR 820.30(g), FDA recommends that \ndevice manufacturers conduct both a safety risk assessment and a separate, accompanying \nsecurity risk assessment to ensure a more comprehensive identification and management of \npatient safety risks.  \n \n32 The TPLC processes include design and development, manufacturing, postmarket monitoring, delivering device \nsoftware and firmware updates, and servicing, among others.  \n33 AAMI TIR57 Principles for medical device security—Risk management describes the security risk management \nprocess and how the security risk management process should have links into the safety risk management process \nand vice versa.  \n34 21 CFR 820.'

An SPDF is a set of processes that help identify and reduce \nthe number and severity of vulnerabilities in products. An SPDF encompasses all aspects of a \nproduct’s lifecycle, including design, development, release, support, and decommission. \nAdditionally, using SPDF processes during device design may prevent the need to re-engineer \nthe device when connectivity-based features are added after marketing and distribution, or when \nvulnerabilities resulting in uncontrolled risks are discovered. An SPDF can be integrated with \nexisting processes for product and software development, risk management, and the quality \nsystem at large.  \n \nUsing an SPDF is one approach to help ensure that the QS regulation is met. Because of its \nbenefits in helping comply with the QS regulation and cybersecurity, FDA encourages \nmanufacturers to use an SPDF, but other approaches might also satisfy the QS regulation. \nB. \nDesigning for Security \nWhen reviewing premarket submissions, FDA intends to assess device cybersecurity based on a \nnumber of factors, including, but not limited to, the device’s ability to provide and implement the \nsecurity objectives below throughout the device architecture. The security objectives below \ngenerally may apply broadly to devices within the scope of this guidance, including, but not \nlimited to, devices containing artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) and cloud-\nbased services. \n \nSecurity Objectives: \n• Authenticity, which includes integrity;  \n• Authorization;  \n• Availability;  \n• Confidentiality; and  \n• Secure and timely updatability and patchability.  \n \nPremarket submissions should include information that describes how the above security \nobjectives are addressed by and integrated into the device design. The extent to which security \nrequirements, architecture, supply chain, and implementation are needed to meet these objectives \nwill depend on but may not be limited to: \n  \n• The device’s intended use, indications for use, and reasonably foreseeable misuse;  \n• The presence and functionality of its electronic data interfaces;  \n• Its intended and actual environment of use;24  \n• The risks presented by cybersecurity vulnerabilities;  \n• The exploitability of the vulnerabilities; and  \n• The risk of patient harm due to vulnerability exploitation. \n \n \n24 Manufacturers may not be able to account for all potential environments of use, but should consider the range of \nuse environments and ensure the risks are identified and controlled for the worst-case environments of use (e.g., \nleast secure expected network configuration(s)).'
 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \n \n \n \n 8 \nSPDF processes aim to reduce the number and severity of vulnerabilities and thereby reduce the \nexploitability of a medical device system and the associated risk of patient harm. Because \nexploitation of known vulnerabilities or weak cybersecurity controls should be considered \nreasonably foreseeable failure modes for medical device systems, these factors should be \naddressed in the device design.25 One of the key benefits of using an SPDF is that a medical \ndevice system is more likely to be secure by design, such that the device is designed from the \noutset to be secure within its system and/or network of use throughout the device lifecycle. \nC. \nTransparency \nA lack of cybersecurity information, such as information necessary to integrate the device into \nthe use environment, as well as information needed by users to maintain the medical device \nsystem’s cybersecurity over the device lifecycle, has the potential to affect the safety and \neffectiveness of a device. In order to address these concerns, it is important for device users to \nhave access to information pertaining to the device’s cybersecurity controls, potential risks to the \nmedical device system, and other relevant information. For example: \n \n• A failure to disclose all of the communication interfaces or third-party software could fail \nto convey potential sources of risks; \n• Insufficient information pertaining to whether a device has known but not disclosed \ncybersecurity vulnerabilities or risks may be relevant to determining whether a device’s \nsafety or effectiveness could be degraded; and/or \n• Labeling that does not include sufficient information to explain how to securely configure \nor update the device may limit the ability of end users to appropriately manage and \nprotect the medical device system.  \n \nThis information and other relevant information are important in helping users understand a \nmedical device system’s resilience to cybersecurity threats, the threats that it may be exposed to, \nand how those threats may be prevented or mitigated. Without it, cybersecurity risks could be \nundisclosed, inappropriately identified, or inappropriately responded to, among other potential \nimpacts, which could lead to compromises in device safety and effectiveness. \n \nFDA believes that the cybersecurity information discussed in this guidance is important for the \nsafe and effective use of devices and should be included in device labeling, as discussed below in \nSection VI.  \nD. \nSubmission Documentation \nDevice cybersecurity design and documentation are expected to scale with the cybersecurity risk \nof that device. Manufacturers should take into account the larger system in which the device may \nbe used. For example, a cybersecurity risk assessment performed on a simple, non-connected \nthermometer may conclude that the risks are limited, and therefore such a device needs only a \nlimited security architecture (i.e., addressing only device hardware and software) and few \nsecurity controls based on the technical characteristics and design of the device.

By integrating SPDF processes during the device design phase, manufacturers can proactively address potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, thus preventing the need for re-engineering when new features are added or when vulnerabilities are discovered after the product is on the market. The SPDF also ensures that medical devices are designed to be secure by default, improving their resilience against potential threats.

Moreover, the implementation of SPDF processes is aligned with FDA guidelines, helping manufacturers meet quality system regulations while enhancing the overall safety and effectiveness of the devices.
