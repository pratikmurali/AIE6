Have we seen this kind of attack? And what do we need to do to protect ourselves? The other benefit of the ISAC is that we can take that information from the victim organization -- we can even anonymize it -- and share it with the rest of the members.As a member and as somebody who's participated in a network like this, when I was at Citibank, for example, I would look at the information that came from the ISAC, and we would use that information to make sure that we were not vulnerable to the same attack. In a perfect world, that is what should happen. Unfortunately, because", "e6beca62-bb0a-4b26-98c7-89b0ed80588b": "because we live in such a litigious society, what happens a lot of times is that an incident occurs, and internal counsel finds out about it as part of the response, and they immediately clamp down on everybody, restricting any information from being shared. They need to protect against any notification of an incident because, ultimately, they are concerned about that information getting out in the public domain and, in turn, being used against them.Too many times, we learn about a cyber-incident in the media \u2013 and I will say very openly \u2013 I have a form letter that we send out that basically says, we're sorry to hear about what happened. Is there anything we can do to help? Can you share the indicators with us? That's what I'm really", "ec50c303-8dfb-4d5b-b0fc-b8830b284a73": "what I'm really after. Usually what happens is I either don't hear from them, or they reply back and say that they can't share anything. A third option is to anonymously share information. We can get it out to the community so that everybody can learn and hopefully not become a victim.The reciprocal effect of sharing is that the victimized organization may learn from what other members of the community have seen and what they experienced. They may get some mitigation recommendations or support from others in the network that could help shorten the downtime. There's definitely some value in sharing, and they could learn from others as well. In my experience, probably one third of the respondents to our inquiry are able to share incident", "27c3865a-e11f-41b8-a8d9-15c1d9655ced": "to share incident information with a strict understanding of anonymity.Is there anything more healthcare-specific that is being done to reduce liability in breach reporting?There are federal liability protections on sharing the type of information we're talking about. However, information sharing is ultimately treated as a legal risk decision by organizations. What we're trying to do at Health-ISAC is to make this more of a business-based risk decision. The corporate legal team can give their advice, but we want the CISOs, the CIO, and the CEO to offer their insights as well. We are planning to provide workshops about this starting this summer. We want the legal advisers to understand that there is a low risk to sharing but great upside", "3e926cdb-e844-4fd3-bbaa-9f73361648be": "but great upside benefit by participating in this sharing network. We hope to change that risk conversation a bit.From a public perception standpoint, we have recent examples where if the CEO had been able to state what happened, adding that they shared openly and actively with Health-ISAC and all the other sharing communities to try to make sure that our partners, our customers, and everybody else were protected, they would have had a much better story to tell. People may be more sympathetic to what's going on instead of what I'm reading about now, which is that the company is being negatively criticized for its lack of a meaningful response.What are the three most important things every organization should be thinking about when it comes", "7f689029-4a0e-4948-9347-521c00364032": "about when it comes to security?First, you must use multifactor authentication on all remote access and privileged user accounts.Second, you must stay up to date on patches. We're still seeing organizations getting beat up and getting attacked because of years-old vulnerabilities. Third, the organization must practice good data backup techniques, and you've got to make sure that those backups actually work. One way to test that is to pretend everything's broken, everything's down. Go build a new system and start from scratch. The questions to be answered in the after-action report would include: Can we restore the systems? How long is that going to take? What's the downtime as a result of that? Is your staff equipped to operate on paper", "0e154764-6632-4bd0-ba21-dfb4f8e1d819": "to operate on paper for that amount of time?Unfortunately, there are countless examples of impact like that, from ransomware especially. In 2022, Health-ISAC was a part of the ZLoader botnet disruption, and in 2023, we participated on the Cobalt Strike botnet disruption. Health-ISAC provided testimony and statistics about how much disruption the botnet caused. Hospital revenue losses and patient impacts, ambulances being diverted to other hospitals because they couldn't take in emergency room patients, and oncology appointments having to be canceled or rescheduled. It caused seriously horrific and very real human impacts.What is your view of the balance between risk acceptance and risk avoidance, especially when patching is involved?There"}}
