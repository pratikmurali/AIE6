On the one hand, there are the lack of resources that these healthcare organizations are struggling with when it comes to proper protection and defense. From a cybersecurity standpoint, many are running on skinny profit margins as it is. Some are losing money and struggling for additional budgets for cybersecurity and subsequent resources.On the other hand, particularly when it comes to patching, an organization can use many of the free resources to approach vulnerability and patch prioritization. For example, CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog is freely available. If an organization can check the vulnerabilities that are on that list, it becomes easier to prioritize", "4960cfb8-f34b-4f68-bb57-19df2eceba67": "to prioritize patch management.How do vendors fit into the work that Health-ISAC performs?Coming from the finance sector to the health sector, and now at Health-ISAC, it is interesting to discover what kinds of organizations are in our membership. It's not just hospitals. We also have medical device manufacturers, insurance companies, pharmaceutical manufacturing companies, and health IT organizations. Some of our members are also creating electronic health record software systems. The whole idea here is that because all of these systems are dealing with sensitive patient information, we want to make sure that they're doing what they can to be secure and that they understand the threat environment that we're dealing with every day.We have", "efefd8ba-3441-4d85-ab57-28899e6035ac": "every day.We have different levels of partnerships with vendor organizations. We host four summits a year around the globe, and vendors and partners participate in those events as well. We also try to make a conscious effort to provide a variety of vendor organizations there. It's not just the same vendors that you see coming to those summits. We're also trying to explore new innovators, maybe even venture capital and early-stage startups. We try to include a good mix of organizations to offer our members a good view of what's coming, what's stable, who the long-term players in this space are, and some new innovators to take a look at.What are the most prominent cyber attacks that are occurring in the healthcare industry?Ransomware is", "5fc3d67f-3f02-4efe-b3fb-4fde8bb4b0d8": "is definitely at the top of my mind for the CISOs that I have spoken with. It's not just their organization, but it's also the partners and suppliers that they use as well that they're concerned about. Healthcare is such an interconnected, complex system, and if any one of your partners' suppliers gets breached, it could reflect back onto your organization as well. Working together and making sure that security is being considered all throughout the whole ecosystem is vital. It's truly a team sport.Third-party partner breaches are a high concern, as are phishing and social engineering.
