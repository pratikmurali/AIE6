ðŸš€ Exciting news in the world of AI! ðŸŒŸ 

Iâ€™m thrilled to share that we have successfully extended the context length of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 8K to an impressive 80K! ðŸŽ‰ This groundbreaking achievement was made possible through efficient Quantization-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) fine-tuning, completing the entire training cycle in just 8 hours on a powerful 8xA800 (80G) GPU machine.

The newly enhanced model demonstrates remarkable performance across various tasks, including natural language understanding, topic retrieval, and long-context processing, while still maintaining its original capabilities over shorter contexts. This significant extension was primarily driven by 3.5K synthetic training samples generated through GPT-4, showcasing the untapped potential of large language models (LLMs) in expanding their context lengths.

We believe that with additional computational resources, the context length can be extended even further! ðŸ’¡ To support future research and collaboration, weâ€™re excited to announce that we will publicly release all resources related to this project, including data, models, and training codes.
